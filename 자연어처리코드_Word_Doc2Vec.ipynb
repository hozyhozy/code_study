       "'Completely frustrating experience. Paid extra money to get the air conditioner with connectivity, but it just doesn\\'t work 9/10 times I try to use it. When it gets to connect to the device, it takes less than a minute to get disconnected again. Tried reinstalling the app, cleared the cache, reset router, replaced the router, but nothing works. Again, I\\'m completely frustrated..Some good features, but this app isn\\'t very smart. You would think once you connect to the device it would give the UI/UX for your specific device. I connected my new stove/oven, but the image used to represent my stove doesn\\'t match my stovetop burner layout. The directions for the oven remote start are written generically to try to fit any product; \"look to see if you have this.\" If they would put some effort into personalizing the experience to the device you purchased, I\\'d rate this higher..This app works perfectly, it allowed us to download many more cycles for our Washer/Dryer. It really has cool features and we don\\'t have any problems with it but there is one thing which is kind of bothering, in the Power Monitoring section it doesn\\'t show almost any useful info about how much electricity has been consumed, it just shows \"rating?\" From 0 to 5. How are we supposed to know how much kWh is 1 and how much kWh is 5? That would make my rating and experience 5/5 :D.Good but not great for an app by LG. Not the most user interface friendly, and few adjustments by user. I downloaded it to add a washer/dryer extra cycles and it does not have some cycles that would be nice to have (like a soak cycle), they are just a bit different, and I can just have the same cycles by adjusting the temp and such on the existing ones..App is useful but limited and requires some updates. The WiFi setup took longer than it should, because the app was not clear about which button turned WiFi on. I had to reference the user\\'s manual to turn on WiFi. I was using this app to use the smart analysis function. All tests pass, but I still have problems getting my new dishwasher to consistently complete a wash cycle. Ideally there would be a test for any component that is causing the dishwasher to stop..I was able to connect to my lg appliances for the first few months. After an upgrade, all appliances show as disconnected, and I can no longer reconnect to my home wi-fi. 1/4/20 update: I emailed as requested, because after reinstalling the app, and resetting my router, I\\'m still not able to connect to all my appliances. There were a couple I was able to connect to, but it took several painful attempts. It keeps saying there are issues connecting with their servers..LG air conditioning - Bugs are mostly fixed. I hope they don\\'t break it again. Now if they would make the app actually useful. Please let me set temperature, mode and fan speed for scheduling. When I set repeating schedule I don\\'t know what the temperature will be a week from now. There\\'s no way to set it to all AUTO because this setting is pretty much useless. Time alone just doesn\\'t cut it..It is not really helpful with my washing machine. Only predesigned programs can be chosen in the app and it does not let you make any modification of temp, spin and so on. It would also be nice to start a second program like spin or dry after washing, but for that you need to go back to your machine and select the remote start again... I just like receiving a notification when my laundry is done but, apart from that, not much value for washers....Right now the app version is V3.0.1700001 and it seems that I can\\'t connect my vacuum cleaner, at least for me it doesn\\'t appear in the screen. However the app tells me that products like styler, oven, washer, including vacuum cleaner can only be added in standby mode, what does it mean?.So far so good. (For Washing Machines). Some minor glitches... Other than OK. What I would like to to see ADDED to the downloadable cycles (in future update) is more TIME OPTION for the TIME DELAY programme. Currently you can only set it up from 3 to 19 hrs. An 1hr time delay would help a lot. Thanks LG..Wifi connectivity is horrible. I purchased a washing machine with wifi connectivity. This app is absolutely horrible at doing that. I have tried all the trouble shooting / router configurations that I could with this, and get an error that the machine is off, and there is no internet connection available. I will end up returning this machine and getting another competitor machine who\\'s app will work. Get it together LG, I will not be a returning customer . All of my other wifi items work fine.The app as it stands, doesn\\'t crash, and works, but alongside a WiFi apppliance has MAJOR shortcomings: 1) Can\\'t turn on remotely!!!! If I have to manually press the on/off botton on applianaces, the wifi feature loses appeal.the app becomes more of toy that a tool. 2) doesn\\'t allow you to setup a time to start any of my appliances. I should be able to set the timezone/time in the app, and then given it\\'s connected to internet, the machine should be able to turn on at the specified time)..Works Great! Didn\\'t think I would like this app working with my washer and dryer as much as I have. It updated the software right away on both the washer and dryer, then has worked flawlessly. I\\'m able to monitor both while running, pause cycles, remote start, and best of all, get reminders when each load is finished and ready for attention..Requires unnecessary permissions to run at all (location, phone calls). App won\\'t launch without these permissions, which are irrelevant to the app\\'s functionality. Update: The developer\\'s response unfortunately does not make much sense. There are a number of other ways for the app to function without requesting or requiring these invasive permissions (and many other apps manage to do so). As others have noted, some other apps will ask for permissions and simply disable advanced features if the permissions aren\\'t granted, but the LG app won\\'t run at all even though none of its features *truly* require these call, media, location permissions. Hopefully LG will note the many customer reviews objecting to the permission requests and make some changes..When the app works its great, but half the time I find it doesn\\'t connect to the wifi. I have checked my wifi and even when I\\'m receiving the best possible signal, it still won\\'t connect to my TV. Instead I have downloaded the other LG app \\'LG TV Plus\\' which I am guessing it\\'s the same creator?.App push notification does not work for letting you know when wash cycle is done. I think it\\'s worked a few times when the cycle is actually done but most times it\\'s hours later when you get the push. Remote start is a joke because you have to turn on remote start for you to be able to remotely start it.... Only reasons I got this washer and it doesn\\'t work. Won\\'t be buying any future lg products..Pain in the butt to get washer and dryer connected to the app...App itself isn\\'t very user friendly...App just suggested updating so I did the update...Went in the app to set up a delay wash cycle and it says that I don\\'t have any appliances connected... Now I have to start the whole process over of getting connected to the app ??.Functional app that allows to run washing machine remotely with standard settings. Cannot modify programs like is possible on the machine itself, but can see the planned ending time of delay that is not possible on the machine. Too slow to get connection via cloud (has no direct connectivity) and quite often shows wrong information at the beginning so you have to wait for the update..The app is kinda useless, unless you have to know exactly when your dishwasher is done. I was under the impression I could turn on the dishwasher from my phone and change the cycles. All I can do is see if the dishwasher is running and how much time is left. I haven\\'t had any issues with the dishwasher yet, so I haven\\'t had to use the customer support part yet..Super privacy invasive. Requires permission to view all your call history just to open the app. Fails to open the app if you reject it. Then it requires your date of birth to sign up. Completely unnecessary to require these. Edit: Developer response is unacceptable. It would be trivial to ask for my country rather than requiring invasive permissions such as viewing all call history..This app is helpful with my dryer and was helpful with my washer. I don\\'tknow if its an app issue or a washer issue. I found that my frustration with my washer is not unique. It set-up with the app immediately after receiving the machine. It continue to work well for several days and then all the sudden, it disconnected and will not connect. My dryer has stayed stable with connection. I have tried the trouble shooting, resetting, uninstalling app, unplugging machine, etc. So frustrating..AC interface wont start after the new update. Just giving me a msg Device wont start, try again later...I would go back to old app if appstore gives this option but no. Dont update the apps if it breaks how it has been working in the previous version. I ve tried reinstalling and restarting the app. Phone is Xperia UltraA1.App works kind of ok... Add appliances is very easy and so far it worked flawlessly... Adjusting the settings can be some challenging as it most of the times did not saved the settings on the first try... Washer, dryer (the ones I own) could have a better and longer usage history logs, including water usage, day and time it ran, along with the items it already logs, for the refrigerator a history of defrost, ice production and water usage also with the items already logged..Almost completely useless! The only thing useful the app does is sometimes it let\\'s you know the dryer is done. Sometimes! You can\\'t turn the dryer on remotely which means you can\\'t restart if you couldn\\'t get the clothes out after the first cycle. Also, the dryer doesn\\'t actually get the clothes dry with normal cycle. The dryer and the app are both a waste of money!.Hire some decent programmers. At the very least publish a decent writeup that \"works\" for each product. I won\\'t even get into questioning why the app needs the BS permissions it asks for. I have 4 major LG appliances. This fridge is the first with WiFi. This sad excuse of an app will make me rethink another LG purchase. --------------- Update After 3 go rounds with support over connection issues I am being totally ignored. Sent them every piece of info they requested. Crickets! 1 LOST CUSTOMER.Just purchased my LG LFX28566S. Downloaded the ThinQ app on my android and cannot get it to connect. Using a 2.4 network and it will reach 60% and then times out. I have tried a number of times with the same result. Very disappointed. Do I return the fridge as alerts are one of the reasons I purchased this product..With app is possible only to switch on and off the air conditioner. Other functions are not available because each time appears a message \"try again to restore normal operation of device\" and the app goes back to basic function: switch on/off and current temperature..10/12/2019: For the last 3 days, cant even connect to the app, everytime i log in it says failed to connect to server. Update 1/19/2020: still same problem, contacted lg and no help whatsoever, telling me to reinstall despite telling them that i have done that several times and tried using the app on a different phone and still getting the same issue..Very good...once I made sure my refrigerator was registered. I had forgotten that I hadn\\'t done so when I first got it so the diagnostics wouldn\\'t perform. After going through the registration, the app worked perfectly! Within a matter of seconds, it was done and over with. Everything is in perfect running order, just the way it should be. Good app. Suggestion, tho...have a reminder at the beginning of the app to make sure products have been registered before using it..It is a very cool app to use with your various LG devices, but I feel the app could be designed better. The way everything is explained for the app could be better. I did not realize that more than one person could connect to it until I began experimenting with setting it all up again with someone else\\'s phone..Downloaded it to work with my LG TV and wouldn\\'t connect for no reason, then randomly decided to connect. Sometimes it will connect to it and other times it won\\'t. There\\'s nothing wrong with the internet, TV, or my phone. I\\'ve followed all the steps to connect it to Alexa and that won\\'t find it, even when it\\'s connected. Rubbish app and a waste of time..Unable to add tv. Tv says the phone was added. Phone gives me an error \"the network information can not be sent to your tv. Connect to the same network as your tv.\". It is the same network. As far as I can tell, it is impossible to add the tv to Alexa w/o this app..I really don\\'t understand the need of so many authorizations and terms. I don\\'t want to make an account or allow the app to have access to my personal information in my phone. I think I could have options in app if chosing country and langage for example. Even my partner approving and authorizing everything, we couldn\\'t find the option we wanted the most as personalized cycles..WAY, WAY TOO MUCH PERMISSIONS! Why does an app that I use to monitor my washer and dryer require permissions to view, modify or delete my phone contacts, read my SD Card contents, make phone calls, change network settings, turn network on if off... etc, etc, etc? Pretty far overreach here LG!.Some time this app is not usable on android, when I want to set new temp for my AC always I got message to try again and app return me to home screen of this very bad app! On iphone this option working normal! Also, you must add option to schedule temperature at some part of day (auto change temp), now we can just auto power on/off AC but we can\\'t set program to auto adjust temperature at some part of day like 08-12 - 23¡Æ, 12-16 - 25¡Æ, 16-08 - 20¡Æ etc. You must add this option!!!.I use this app mostly as TV remote. It\\'s okay, but lacking some basic functionality. It cannot power on the TV - my alexa can do it. There is no keyboard - arguably the most important tv app feature. Roku app had that working 5+ years ago. Keep up the good work, and hopefully we will see some updates soon..Used to work with the washer with no issues. Then after the last update or so it just immediately signed me out and tells me my login details are incorrect. I use a password manager, so no they aren\\'t but whatever I go and reset it and sure enough on the latest update we have the same situation again, signed out and needs reseting again. I shouldn\\'t need to be logged in to just to use nfc anyway so uninstalled. Maybe they will fix it at some point..I can\\'t believe how hard it was to connect to my washer the first time. The written directions just left me guessing, but to be fair I did notice that the app was changing too a new wifi SSID to find and setup the washer. More progress information would give do better to set expectations. Never sit there and leave the user wondering what\\'s going on for minutes. There\\'s a red key crossed out on my washer. Makes me think it\\'s missing the wifi security key - but then it couldn\\'t be talking..As usual LG never diappointed me. Please follow Cyndy Cook suggestion below review. Make sure your appliances are registered. Latest update (i have written this review on 12/22/2019) is perfect. My special request to LG is please include Energy Ctrl option in next update (80%, 60%, 40%) in ThinQ app please...This ensures no need of remote control in hand but we can control remotely with app. Thank you in advance for considering my request in next update..Be neat if it worked more than twice! Kist keepa freezing not to mention the only way to truly exit the app is to force it to stop running in the background. no option in the app to use a keyboard in order to type on smart tvs within apps or say to sign in. Without that feature for tvs one is better off with the lg tv plus app, even though it also lacks the same thing..Completely useless app. Wanted to use the Download Cycle for a Tag On machine. The cycles you can download are things like \"Full load\", \"New clothes\" etc. You cannot set or see what the temperature, spin cycle etc will be. In short, completely useless..App won\\'t even start. Complains that my phone is rooted, no idea why it cares. Edit: support admitted to me that their app is spyware, and tries to collect a list of installed apps. If you have root related apps installed, their app reports it and dies. Dev keeps insisting their spyware is acceptable. It\\'s not, nor is it acceptable that they attempt to dictate what I do on my hardware..Required unreasonable permissions (all-time location, phone calls) refuses to run if they are not granted. My washing machine should not need permissions, and no app should be unable to run in a degraded mode without permissions. (per reply below: There\\'s no reason the app should need to get country from sim rather than asking user, or indeed from the location permission it also asks for. Equally there is no reason it should not accept location-only-when-running rather than location-always. Especially for an app with ads, location-always and phone permissions are obviously unreasonable).server failed to connect, no response from the server. Try again later. App is useless, tried all the usual stuff like delete app cache/data, uninstalled and reinstalled, app has not worked in months due to error above, tried on home WiFi, 4g mobile data, no issues with other apps, using galaxy s10+. Also although I did allow access, why on earth does this app need telephone permission and location permission absolute joke of a app and company. Will never buy an LG product again..The app has been working fine the last couple of months they\\'ve worked out a few issues with the reconnection issues and that was very important because it was very frustrating so. So making that statement at this point I have to give it a 5-star rating!.Everything about this app feels a bit 2013 and non-polished. I guess it works, but it\\'s not very slick or pleasing to use. Also, why does it show the weather?? Lowered review by one star because of all the additional permissions. Edit December 2019: apparently this app reads my location in the background. Great, 1 star..Demands permanent access to Phone Calls and Location permissions at startup and refuses to run if permission is denied or restricted to when the app is running. Neither of these is necessary for any reasonable functionality of the app. Today my refrigerator quit working. It defrosted everything in my freezer. NO notification from the app. Manually running diagnostics in the app says everything is fine and working even though the freezer is currently over 40F when it should be 0F..App is disappointing. It lacks a lot of features I expected when I chose an LG combo washing machine with WiFi. My wishlist: 1. Better controls over the settings on remote start. 2. Notification on start of cycle when using delay end time 3. Logging of actual time from start to finish of washing and drying 4. Better energy monitoring. It should show the actual watt-hr usage instead of just icons. This feature is so useless that Ihad to use a separate power meter for this purpose..Very helpful, failed first attempt, but had to close fridge to restart diagnosis, then work properly and said nothing wrong, just fridge left open for to long it told us that the fridge had been open 41 times in the last day. Probably why nothing seemed cold..You set the washer and dryer for remote start by pressing a button on the machine. This renders the option almost useless. I essentially paid $200 extra for Wi-Fi capable appliances just to get an alert on my phone that a load of laundry is done..Eh. It\\'s not so great. With a washer and dryer it takes an extremely long time to get the values updated. The washer also drops offline all the time which makes the app completely useless but LG refuses to acknowledge the issue..This is below average compared to other competitors like Samsung. I bought the C9 assuming that their equivalent ThinQ has the capabilities to add family members to control LG devices. Unfortunately, this is not the case and have not found a workaround. Also, my voice assistant can\\'t control the TV directly because it needs to go through a gateway (ThinQ) to accept commands..Horrible. I hoped that I could type the text at the app. But is just the same functions from the remote at the phone. At least I the voice could be available. 100MB and is worse than an IR app that I already use. Seriously... Should have bought another brand of TV. Have always been happy with Panasonic. Will go back to it at next TV..Product status is slow. It doesn\\'t always connect. I logged out of the app and back in and lost all of my connected products! Also, still haven\\'t found a way to do multi-user so my wife can use a separate account to monitor the same products. Horrible app. Will not be buying LG ever again. Worst application experience from what I use to consider a top-tier competitor in the appliance space..Spent over an hour, and can\\'t get my new washer dryer to connect to the internet. They do connect to wifi, but without registering themselves to the LG server they delete themselves from the app. I have done everything I can think of on my end, disabling firewalls and such on my router, but nothing works. At least the machines work without the app. Edit: Still nothing working, and I am about to just give up on LG for future purchases..App works fine but it can\\'t connect with Google Home App! WHY??? Why should I unlocked my phone, launch the app and finally press the power button, instead of just saying one phrase??? Please be better and try to fix this!! It\\'s not that big of a deal!!!.This app (and the LG wireless thermostat are junk. 1) when the power goes out the furnace shuts down and doesn\\'t appear to restart. When the temperature drops down outside of acceptable the app doesn\\'t notify me like NEST. 2) in the schedule section, you can chose on and off but not decide temperature. 3) the app schedule doesn\\'t sync with the wall control. 4) when integrated with Google home, only power on or off functionality is retained. Save your money and invest in a NEST for the same pric.I was hoping to use this for my new lg washing machine. I get an error message saying that it cannot run on a rooted device. My device galaxy a70 is not rooted and I still get this message. Please fix this issue..Rewriting: I ran out of space so I deleted fluff so I can say this app STILL SUCKS!. I finally got it to work in early November. Went to use it today and my appliances have vanished. Honestly, could not be more disappointed in an app, a customer service dept or a company as a whole. Truly regret my decision. Update: now the app will not even open. simply crashes at start up. And yes, i uninstalled and reinstalled. Absolutely nothing..This app is horrible! It is missing buttons to add appliances. The app itself crashes lot and the connection between appliances and the server is hit and miss. The app won\\'t open with out talking to server. Why the ads, for product we paid extra for Wi-Fi connectivity, why have large ads in the App?.Nice app that can help users in the way of smart diagnosis. But diagnosis error result having bug in case of top load washing machine. This is confirmed by LG support care as well that this app shows result of previous error state. Actual issue I\\'m getting in washing machine is dE i.e. door error, it says it might be opened or not working but in my case it closed and working fine. Thus washing machine is fine but app is not. Plese fix it developers.....Edit: A year has gone since I gave my review of this app and the LG TrueStream washing machine. And still there\\'s no wool program to be downloaded. This must be the most useless app and feature for a washing machine in washing machine history. Sales trick made to grab your money. What washing machine doesn\\'t offer a wool program anyway? It\\'s stupid. And the washing machine and this app doesn\\'t even have a wool program. Neither preinstalled on the machine nor to download via the app..The app no longer works due to overreaching permission requests. Since the update it requires permissions to make calls (which I refuse). Most apps simply disable features if you deny permissions to specific things. This one won\\'t launch *at all* if you deny it ability to make calls. In my case this app is used to notify me when my dishwasher cycle is complete. Why on earth would I allow it to make calls? Their statement says its used for \"smart diagnosis\" and customer support calls.Used to work fine then had a repair done by lg under warranty and it lost connection to app try setting it up again but says product is not supported. Zero help from lg and not even a reply from app developers. Without having the app you cant even just put it on a rinse and spin cycle.Garbage, I\\'ve been trying for months to add my SK9000PUA 55 inch led tv and there is always an error, at first the app worked but then it deleted the tv of the list of appliances, now I can\\'t add it again, this app is a total waste of time..Initially rented 2 stars, then had to downgrade to 1 star. Every time when router is power cycled, the WiFi module fail to connect in auto mode, , thus resulting.un.near zero availability. Absolutel awful application. Connects to the aircon intermittently. Frequently cant connect due to server unavailability. when connected, works well, thus 2 stars. otherwise I\\'d rate it only 1 star. expected to get something better from a reputable LG brand. Raw and unfinished when compared to competitor..Although it may sound silly to some, I actually enjoy the polite notification that my Washer and Dryer hit me up with. It cheers me with the little song at the end of each cycle as well. The notification from them also helps me remember to flip said laundry in the first place; a reminder I sorely need in today\\'s busy world..Whenever i receive the message that notify me of the the completed wash cycle, i tried to click the notification to proceed with a rinse cycle. But it always takes a long time for the app to load. By the time i get into the app, the washer is already switched off. I have to do it manually. Is there any workaround/updates?.This is a good app. It works well, but you can customize how you want you laundry washed. You can only pick from the factory settings and can\\'t change things like water temp, extra rinse, etc.Definitely needs work. No ability to remotely turn on the washer and/or dryer. For certain drying cycles, constantly receiving server connection error messages. No way to adjust the settings through the app on existing cycles (e.g. change the dryness level, adjust drying time under the Time Dry option, etc...). Definitely would not recommend unless the dev teams make so major usability updates!!.In current version app doesn\\'t show current consumption of the electricity in Air Condition setting (monitoring). Previous UI was much better. Additionally app (account) cannot be link to Google Home. It doesn\\'t work almost an year and LG really doesn\\'t care to much. Therefor I cannot recommend to buy LG product anymore..App is a necessity. My dishwasher was having issues and would stop during cycles and I would need to restart it. Sometimes it would not start at all. To diagnose the issue I installed the app and the dishwasher automatically did a firmware update. It is working fine now..It\\'s not linking to alexa very well! Ever since their last stupid system update last week whenever I ask lg to change to a hdmi number on their smart tv IT JUST PULLS UP WHAT TIME THE HDMI NUMBER IS ON TV FOR GOOGLE SEARCH RESULTS on the tv via alexa! And it was working just fine beforehand! I am disgusted that now I cannot ask it to change to a tv input via voice!.The app doesn\\'t keep time with the washer and dryer. And I can\\'t remote start the washer snd dryer!! WTH! So to me the extra hard earned dollars I spent on the WIFI option is just a fancy remote buzzer to let me know when the cycle is done... USELESS waste of money.Expected more from this app. Seeing the appliance but still stating that WiFi is unstable. Clearly LG needs to review this issue as it renders this app useless. All other appliances and devices are working fine, just LG that has missed the plot. LG fix your app! No wonder your brand is losing customers!.The app should be much better than it is, the app does not stay connected to the washer, and you would think you could change the water temperature of different wash programs, the machine is good but lg have been very lazy.Did what the instructions told me to do held the phone to the smart logo on the top right of my refrigerator held my phone to it pushed the freezer button in for 3 seconds sound went off and my refrigerator still didn\\'t connect I tried it several times and it doesn\\'t work. I have a LSXS26466S.Last update has stopped all notifications!! When my front load wash has finished i don\\'t get notifications to my mobile anymore. Have not changed any settings & all are correct. Your app is now useless to me unless a fix update is sent through, please fix!!.air condition control on app don\\'t have sleep mode for plus temp+1¡Æc and cann\\'t fix time to turn off and don\\'t have function light off and don\\'t have energy control and don\\'t have function auto clean font washer machine cannot power on and control by app but must be open remote control function on device before front wash can not start and control if don\\'t open function on machine before.App is somewhat useful. I wish you could choose your own options on the washer (such as water temp) when making selections on the download washes. Also, sometimes the app is really buggy, I\\'ve had to disconnect the the appliance and reconnect to the app twice per my call to LG for assistance..Too limited. When you choose a cycle, you can\\'t change any options. That\\'s additional to the fact that, every single time, you need to turn the washer AND Remote Start option on for it to work with the app..Ruined because of the ads. You pay a ton for the appliances and the last thing you want to see is ads. I want functionailty snd its not too much to ask to remove the ads. Love the appliances and avoid the ap for this reason.This app makes my life easier. It can be connected to google home service, so I can turn on or off my aircon with voice command. And when my device had a problem, it proved to be useful in helping me to find what\\'s causing it..Spent over two hours, and can\\'t get my new washer & dryer to connect to the internet. They do connect to wifi, but without registering themselves to the LG server they delete themselves from the app.I registered them both on LG, I used same email to make an LG account. I have done everything I can think of on my end, disabling firewalls and such on my router, but nothing works. Please fix the app.can not install the app, crashes allways! the app is incredibly large! !!! >:( after few tries to install, was successful. not bad app, all-in one, so I\\'ve uninstalled the LG Smart TV remote controller app..Have tried to connect this app to my LG 55\" smart 4k TV and it picks it up but never manages to add the device to my device list. Tried it with different phones as well. Currently using a Samsung s10+. My experience is the app is buggy and pretty much useless if I can\\'t connect my devices.Very useful for a busy mom with lots of kids I don\\'t have to keep running down the stairs to check to see if it\\'s done I get notifications and loud sounds that let me know that it\\'s finished and I love how customizable it is for different loads cuz I\\'m very picky with how I wash my laundry..Slow to load. And not real clear on uses. Great feedback on maintenance. But have yet been able to use it for anything except to tell me when a cycle has ended.I have the problem with my refrigerator and the app tell me that everything is right. The temperature is bad, when I check the smart diagnostic said, everything is good..When connecting to washing LG washing machine the app is reliable but when connecting to LG thin Q TV app is unreliable. I am using a mesh WiFi network at home, washing machine is connecting all the time but TV is working only sometimes..Horrible app. Can\\'t log into it no matter what I do with it. Have reset my password multiple times. Used email and registered name. Feels like I\\'m losing out on functionality that I paid extra to have. 3 LG TVs, 2 LG soundbars, LG Washer and dryer,.I don\\'t seem to be able to download a guide thta tells you what the cycles are before you pick them. So you have to go through uploading each one to your machine to know temperature and time length..There is no option to add the LG Range hood anywhere on the APP. Even customer service could not help. The model number is LSHD3080ST. The wifi just blinks on the hood and not connecting. Very disappointed.Keeps pushing alerts all day and night that \"the app is now running\" despite having all notifications turned off in the settings. Had to block them in the Android system settings. Otherwise works ok..Work great to check the progress on my washer dryer. Though it take a while to load. Use it to check the water consumption on my Puricare water filter also. Very good experience..Worst ever experience both with machine and this app.Both r not working .If this is happening on installation of washing machine today I.e.28th dec 2019 ,only god knows how many times I need to call technicians . I received a replaced washing machine on 8th Jan 2020 Today on 9 jan 2020 finally a technician got it installed and luckily its functioning well.To lessen my fear I had taken AMC worth rs 3400 and hope all goes well.Now I will give 5 stars to this diagnosis..Ok, but needs some improvement. Would be nice to change push notifications only when I am home by using geofencing or same WiFi to tell me when washer or dryer is done. I do not need to know about others washing clothes when I am out of the house..Unable to login to my LG account. \"ID or password is not correct\". Can login to my LG account on laptop browsers and mobile phone browsers. Just the app that cant handle it. No use whatsoever..Terrible apps. And terrible washer. Terrible Dryer. LG WASHER DOESN\\'T EVEN USE ENOUGH WATER. That mean said, when washed with water, and when I dry it, it always stinks. Dryer doesn\\'t even dry the clothes which even makes it more worst. LG, YOU MIGHT WANT TO REPROGRAM YOUR WASHER TO PUT MORE WATER..Terrible app experience. The delay for connecting to your dryer is unbearable. App notifications leave little to be desired but they are functional which is why I gave it two stars..Work terrible. I do not recommend this app. The app shows that my dryer is connected, but when I go to the settings, I cannot control it. Called customer service and they have no idea what to do. Very unhelpful. customer service states that they have never seen anything like this before.Sucks as it will not run on a rooted device. Update, got it running on a rooted device. There is no security threat from my device being rooted, what a load of baloney..Used with new LG aircon. App worked OK at first, but after an app update a few weeks ago it no longer shows power usage. That was my main reason for using the app. Why remove a useful feature? Please bring it back..Now that we live in a duplex with shared laundry this app is helpful. We always know when the washer and dryer are finished their cycles. Not \"forgetting\" laundry in the machines. I only wish I could use it remotely to restart the dryer.App is OK but there is not much functionality, but I assume that depends on the product. We have a side by side and you can only set temps and express freeze. I would like to be able to schedule ice machine etc..I have to uninstall this buggy app and reinstall about once a week. Which means I have to reapprove all the permissions, fix all the poor default settings, and reconnect to my TV..Nice Apps but more cycles and more choices should be available. This requires that hardware, machine be more versatile. Please mKe the add appropriate to dishwashing and more informative to end users..I installed the app to connect it with a LG fridge. After multiple tries and 2 accounts created on different platforms the app failed to connect with the product. LG products are pretty bad at UI/UX and this app confirms it (I own a LG tv also)..Gear app, however, it took more than 5 times to find the error code on the display and used to say that everything was OK. Finally, it showed the error code and gave a proper diagnosis..Cannot run on a rooted device?!? I have never rooted this phone! I just got a new washer and cant even use some of its features because of this! P.S. Why does it matter if someone using this app has a rooted phone? What\\'s wrong with wanting a little more freedom for your own personal device?.I have this for my washer and dryer. Not a horrible app but I wish it was more customizable when loading a cycle ir that there were more options. Everything is greyed out. I do like the self diagnostics and time remaining and tub clean reminders.This app is very helpful. There could be work done to make setting up wash and dry cycles a bit more customizable, and the iOS version had trouble setting up a dryer after a washer was successfully set up (freezing), but overall, the app is terrific and works reliably. Great job LG!.Wifi connectivity for my washer dryer is pointless. Have to manually turn on the appliance, and when it turns off it stays off. Cannot turn on appliances remotely. Definitely a disappointment..Terrible app. Would not connect, because there is a wall between my router and the washer. I cannot move my router to the utility room!!.Meh. Basically the app just tells you when your laundry is done. What I want is the ability to start the dry cycle from the app when I get notified the wash is done. Isn\\'t that kind of the point? To be able to operate it remotely?.The process of adding a new device could greatly be improved. It is cumbersome and frustrating. Also, Google assistant support is limited for now, meaning that it doesn\\'t work right now in my country..I used the app to download dry program only on a washer-dryer machine combo. The slot clears upon power outage. Now I cannot use it because it requires location and phone calls permissions... really? How about no.. and I will no longer buy any other Lg products for this kind of intrusion.Energy Monitor feature is not comprehensive. Not reliable. It says 20 day 16hr and 9 min operation time for a week. Where the hell is the 15day coming from where it only have 7 days in a week. Please fix this..Works well. It probably isn\\'t a necessary feature but it is nice to have. Tells me when it is time to clean the tub and it will automatically order laundry detergent (through Amazon) when I run low..This App tells one NOTHING about the Download Cycles i.e. it does not give details of the set temperature, maximum load, spin speed etc. Waste of time! And no point in the \\'feature\\'. It appears that LG employs dumb programmers and dumb overseers like most other companies..Does not connect to google home Edit: apparently its not compatible with tvs before 2018. It seems likes theres no plans to remedy this with an update. Seems like a way to sell more tvs..I took a while to set up, but now even so, there\\'s not much customization you can do. I would have also thought that I\\'d be able to access my product\\'s user guide through here..The worst app to control an LG OLED TV. Does not work with Alexa echo, it wants you to press a button on the remote to control alexa which defeats the purpose of hands free..Completely useless, refuses to connect. Don\\'t bother with it. EDIT: I removed the app and reinstalled and managed to get it all connected in the end..Love that it tells me when the clothes are done and I don\\'t hear the chimes as I am in another room or out of earshot of the machine..The app helped me to diagnose the problem in the washing machine. The steps were explained properly and easy to perform. The app gave the solution and I was able to rectify the error by myself.Pretty solid app. Does what it claims and worked consistently. Can\\'t ask for much more than that. Working with my dishwasher and fridge..Opened the app ONLY to use tapon with my LGFC1408R4W. Of course it doesn\\'t work. No functionality, just word text from poorly parsed data in app. Good thing I had to create an account for this garbage. Need to upload the screenshot.Love that it tells me when my washer and dryer are done! I can change the settings if I want! WiFi capability is so convenient!.Unimpressed. The appliance has no instructions on how to select a wifi network or enter a password. How is it supposed to connect?.Despite claims in marketing materials, Thinq does not effectively integrate with Google Home. This appears to have been a widely known problem on the internet for years, and it seems LG has done nothing to address..LG Thinq can\\'t connect my LG TV to google home. Instead of devices from another trademarks like Sony or Xiaomi which connects without any problems. Also Google assistant on TV not active due region restrictions ..Very nice. However should include the options for each washer cycle present in the physical washer like changing temperature, etc. The consumption graphic do not have any useful information (wash time, kw, etc)..Yes it is helpful because it tell for all the problems in our washing machine and I love this thing that it does not ask for model number because some people don\\'t know where is the model number situated and all things are goods in the app.Does not work on my Android device connected to the TV. So I need to always have phone nearby. If on the TV, any and every one can see it and wash a new load..Permissions are an unjustified invasion of privacy, claiming requiring location permission to \"verify location information when connecting to Wi-Fi products\" is akin to saying \"we need this because we need it\". And instead of forcing us to allow phone call management to identify country and language settings, how about you allow us to provide that instead, as a fallback?.Since your last update, all the data of my Vacuum Robot disappeared...and I can\\'t sync it to my wifi. After the first step( push on Turbo and the received signal- nothing more appear on the screen - steps 2+3).Step by step instruction not useful. Unable to add device. Read the refrigerator instruction as well, not helpful. Can\\'t use this so called smart app.Will not connect with my brand new top load washer but connects fine with my dryer. Matching set, both wifi enabled. For some reason it will not connect....The app updated last week and disconnected from ducted air conditioning. Tried many times to connect, it didn\\'t function. Poor application, waste of money and time.While out of town, I busted my husband sleeping on our bare mattress while the sheets were washing thanks to this app. Now, after 7 years, he knows where the spares are. This app is so handy for forgetful and easily distracted people like me, who don\\'t want to have to hear repeated timers. I haven\\'t explored the other handy features much, but the text alert alone is worth it..The app added the washer but the only thing the app does is smart diagnose everytime I try to select the cycle. I went through the smart diagnose process but it comes back to the same screen everytime I select the washer..Your app does not connect, to the appliance. And your UI is garbage, you cannot show your embedded text in app. Server not responding. Useless app.Keeps going round in circles trying to sign me in multiple ways when I try to add products. So, won\\'t do anything at all. Have created LG account and registered washer/dryer and still no go. 0 stars if was possible...The app is supposed to be connect to Google assistant, but this does not work in my region (Slovenia). don\\'t see why review controlling my air conditioner needs to be region limited.App worked fine untill I download update. Now I can only turn on PC12EQ and thats it, not a single thing more. First time I see update is worst then version before. Offcourse now I cant download version that worked ok.Seems to work well. Firmware update was quick and easy. No problems with remote. Tells me when washer and dryer are finished if I\\'m not in the house. I like it ??.Warning. This app now requires location access and phone access just to operate you window AC. No thanks. Edit: one thing I\\'ve learned after reading the other reviews is to never buy an LG appliance!.great app, like being able to start a wash or dryer cycle from away from home, check the status of loads via Google assistant and Alexa devices.My range will not work with Google Assistant. Resolved by correcting language setting in Google Home app. Now all I need is a list of voice commands that work..can\\'t register same product for multiple devices!! + They ask you to register with full details for using your own appliance. Why do you need to know my birthday and home address if all I want is to turn off and on my appliance?!.This app changes its privacy policy too much. Almost twice a month I have to agree to something like a lawyer. Otherwise some contents and functionality features are acceptable.Will not run on rooted phones. LG, your reasoning is foolish. It is easy to hide root from your app. Any security issues you are trying to prevent are still there..This is so cool! Helped me see if my dryer was running properly. Great app and products!!.They orphaned the prior Smart ThinQ URL when they renamed the app. Makes it hard to auto-fill my login. I would like less shilling of Amazon auto-refill of detergent and more laundry care links. I am dubious that any mfg will support an app and infrastructure for the 15+ years a W&D should last..Slow aggravating slow! system dead when no internet for them to monitor you... does not run on its own. Forced to view Amazon ads and hate Amazon. DISAPPOINTED..App is no longer working, saying web browser needs to be updated. Please fix this bug..Just starting to use app. Seems to have great promise, however. Already see that it helps me be more time efficient. Looking forward to learning all the features..Doesn\\'t work if you use it to turn off TV. Crashes when you try to link the app to Google Home. Pretty much useless..Useful app, but needs more work on connectivity issues. It will be better if user can select options to customise a wash/dryer cycle or adjust timing..LG pairing with Google Home is broken. trying to link google home by choosing the Thinq provider it just exits without any error. .LG needs to fix this!.Many functions are grayed out and cannot be toggled + having to pass the control to the app from the washer\\'s panel is annoying.. Very basic app.A recent update removed the energy monitoring feature for my air conditioners. Put it back LG! That was one of the primary reasons I purchased your products!.Awesome. Just a wish. In the Refrigerator mode, the refrigerator door open alert is needed..Installed this app, discovered this app needs my gps location and the ability to make and monitor phone calls, uninstalled this app. That\\'s stupid. Fix the permissions..The app constantly disconnects and blames the network connection even with full bars on my 500up/500down fiber connection. Update: 12/30/19 reinstalled, no change..Tub clean coach does not work, nfc tag works downloads to 100% then goes back to original state, it used to work in the past, not anymore..The app works for me but it can not connect to my Google home at all. Please fix it so it can work with google home..Can\\'t even create an account with this app! Are you kidding? You must jump through hoops to even connect this device to Alexa. I will NOT be buying another LG TV. You guys need to fire your CTO!.Downloaded App to use for control of LG 32LM63. App recognised the tv but did not register the tv and did not load past stage 1 of the three stage process. Therefore unable to use..App is great, but it would be better if I could click on the item that \"replace now\" shows up on so that I can order replacements..It is much improved. We are enjoying the ability to have it connect to Google home..Only thing i wish (may be my appliances) that you could power them on remotely. Starting a cycle remotely is nice to dewrinkle things, but thats about all the use i have for the app.This App needs a lot of work. Won\\'t open, just cycles for 3-4min then gives message that the server is not responding. Same result in the IOS app.Very quite dishwasher. Dishes come out very clean. So far app is working great. I wish we can change the settings after dishwasher start the cycle.Very good ! I found it quite easy to set up and follow instruction for quick diagnosis..Awesome app that gives you access and control without reaching out for your remote control..Great App!! Very useful for getting a diagnosis of fridgere or simply for usi g such as remote control for TV.I have an LG Dryer DLE1101* All in all I thought it was pretty good and yes it helped fix my issue...(would get 5 star bout have to create an account before use).Push notifications about washer and dryer status are great, but otherwise pretty limited in what can be done remotely..Having an excellent time using this app on Google Pixel 2, these are my first LG appliances. Highly satisfied with the features so far, and excited to figure out more as I continue to use the washer and dryer in conjunction with ThinQ..Doesn\\'t connect to my Google home , the account links but it can only turn the volume up and down, mute and stuff but can\\'t launch apps and stuff.Just an average app. Has issues holding WiFi connections which may be equipment related. Custom programming interface simplistic but not intuitive..Cant be fully wifi smart operations. Still need to manually press the ON button. Please improve your updates and make it smart thinQ.Switching between screens in application menu is not working, also connection to Google Home. I can\\'t even log out..Connects to the dryer but won\\'t connect to the washing machine after deleting and retrying a few times. The app has potential just flakey..So nice being able to look and see how much time is left. It\\'s also nice to load up washer, go out, and have it kick off an hour before i get home. No more wash just sitting for hours.Good start. Now when my water or air filter needs replaced, give me access to the part number or a link to buy online. Then 5stars..Can\\'t connect using an NFC. Why do I need to register and allow WiFi, location and stuff for a NFC connection which is not working?.The application doesn\\'t workl ! The download fails every time! Also one star is too much!.I bought an LG washer and dryer hoping that I would be able to use both of them off of the app come to find out you only can use one unit per phone that sucks.Hate That I spent as much as I did on the device this is for and still have to watch ads pop up on my screen..\"Cannot connect to server\" when it\\'s connected to wifi and machine.Washer/Dryer Time Doesn\\'t Display When Using Tag On.. My washer/dryer set isn\\'t wifi compatible but has Tag On. Doesn\\'t the time remaining on the washer/dryer suppose to show even when using NFC?.Notification 5*, remote control 0* I love the notifications but the lack of changing settings when controlling the wascher remotely is a joke....Useful app to diagnosis and treatment keep track of filters health and notifications when for is left open..I found the app to be very helpful. It beats looking for the manual or calling customer service. Very satisfied with it.This app was helpful until recent update. Apparently no longer supports my LG heat pump which is only a year old..Installed on new phone keeps asking me to update my browser can\\'t even open the app. Takes me to the store where browser is updated and just says open.It actually is quite useful. Allows us to upload various alternative washing cycles. Diagnostic tool helpful too.Really good app I use it whenever my washer comes up with an error and it always helps me work out what\\'s happened, 10/10 ??.Old app worked fine for 3 months, but new app after 5 phone calls to Lg support and 5 hours of trying it does not install..App Seems okay WiFi adaptor is flakey. Turns off and needs to be set up again..Can\\'t turn on washer or dryer if it is off. Therefore can\\'t use app to control the appliances unless they are already on..App constantly fails to connect to the dishwasher even though I know it is connect to the internet (I do get status texts)..Only good to notify you once the cycle no is done. Appliance turns off after cycle and cannot be controlled..Makes internet-of-things seem like a pathetic fad. Use it with my washer, and each feature is more useless than the next. In order to remotely start the washer, I have to do the following: Fill the washer/put in soap and physically turn on the machine. Hold a button to switch to \\'remote start\\' (which disables all controls on the actual washer while it\\'s on). Start the app (that somehow needs both BT and wifi). Wait for it to find the device. Select program etc. and start the cycle. Why??.This app is great so easy to use and it integrates with my LG smart TV too!.What the hell do my appliances have to do with my phone being rooted? Useless App EDITED/ADDED: For security reasons my phone is rooted. I control root thus I control my phone. Your app cannot be a security issue to me, my phone or my appliances. Your view on security is horribly misguided. I\\'m a Linux user and this is not an iCrap device..Other than the Amazon ad,I enjoy the usefulness of this app. Makes laundry on most long days useful..Can only control one appliance!!# i bought 5 LG wifi enabled appliances and can only manage one with the app. REALLY. USELESS.I would like to use this app to set up Alexa without giving permission to manage calls. Unnecessarily invasive app.??.It will be easy if button press and scan. Its not good for opening fridge door for 5 times within 8 sec to trigger event.Connecting to WiFi was a pain in the ass. Update your instructions..Works as advertised. Super cool known when my laundry is done. Love how it orders more detergent for me when I\\'m almost out!.Would be gd without the ads, seeing that paid for the washing machine and the WiFi is just a nice to have feature..Works as described, but limited functionality on our older machine with NFC..I can\\'t get my TV to connect to Alexa and it\\'s pisses me off!.Love LG TVs, don\\'t like this app, or Alexa support. \"If it powering on, check wifi\". Wholly shebus....I wish I could at least start my dishwasher with this app since my stupid 5 month old dishwasher\\'s control panel is already broken. I cant start a load and it is ridiculous..A decent alternate to magic remote. It would have been perfect has there been screen casting option in this app..Love it!! I can be upstairs and still know when cycle finished..It is annoying that the app has weather and advertising permanently displayed on the home screen..Fantastic App, we use it for our LG Washer Dryer, very useful and saves time..Requires invasive permissions, requires agreeing to transfer personal data out of EEA. Promptly uninstalled..Handy... Had some trouble connecting a second phone to the washing machine but I\\'ll report back on that. It would be nice if it hadn\\'t tub clean and filter cleaning notifications also..Improved. New version is faster. Connects \"more better\"..So far so good. I did have trouble connecting it in the beginning but got it after a few tries..Constant notifications that ThinQ is running, yet no notifications that my laundry is done. Previous version was better.Precise and very helpful in notifying me when my load is ready!.Love getting notifications when I\\'m busy. Thank you LG, love your washer and dryer..Doesn\\'t do much but nice to get notifications when done.,would be nice to be a bit more functional.I can\\'t figure out the password, its not mentioned anywhere. Requires far too many permissions for an app to control a fridge! Can anyone tell me where to find the password, please?.Wow, problem fixed with app diagnosis. Thank you!.Looking for the tub clean coach to actually coach me. I am not getting any alerts or popups for the need to run the tub clean cycle. I feel this is an easy add in that should be on the app for a dishwasher or washing machine..App is easy to navigate and meets the needs of the product..It\\'s awesome! Love not running around to see where things are at..Pointless App for W/D set. Can\\'t actually control the w/d from app. Also can\\'t use steam or sanitize functions on either..Even though the washer is older, the app diagnosed the correct problem using the washer\\'s sounds..I love it, it tells me when the laundry is done and lets me manage it from the app.WiFi little tricky to setup..restart app when frozen and it was connected.How does this work for everything but soundbar. Hello LG you make audio too..Disappointed..i was looking for a program \"spin-only\". Or i would appreciate a fully manual program, whose settings i can change the way i want. Why don\\'t you provide these?.Great option to have saved a lot of time checking on the washer and dryer.Useless app for my cooktop. Additionally it has useless ads built in..... Looking forward for a useful update..Not really useful if unable to add custom washing cycles or to customise the cycles..Works good, told me what is wrong and now its working. Should of done it sooner..Very helpful and convenient lets me know when it is done and gives me a set time off how long it takes great app.Seems to work pretty good so far for my new fridge. All functions available including temperature control.Fast and simple. Provides appliance updates and status..Useful for the washer. Cannot get the dryer to connect..After last update I can\\'t connect to my wall mount pump heater..Works well with our new LG washing machine. No problems to report..Like bit don\\'t love it. Would like more details about wash history and length of was and dry cycles and number of cycles done per week or month...Wont let me login with LG account, gmail, facebook or Amazon, therefore unusable!.Will not connect to the LG true steam washer or dryer via NFC :(.Easy to use but what is the exchange/ I have a lg window unit it says to use the exchange regularly in the maintenance instructions.Nice app, especially to let you know to when a cycle is done..It says my device is not compatible for NFC Function. Please fix it..I have lg front loading washing machine FHT1208SWW but why should not connect with mobile wifi and hotspot directly like as led smart tv,without wifi routers?.Stupid app, can\\'t connect to my side by side LG refrigerator..Good app, helps me keep in touch with all my appliances!.sp bad...2019 almost 2020 and this is still 2013 app...long story short only in US and UK you can intergrate the app with Alexa....Won\\'t connect to Alexa in Ireland because of geographical restrictions.Super helpful! Love knowing when things are done!.Can access remotely without any problem. All good..Thank You ! Lg Company ,Very Easy Use Full This App And Controlling Fridge Cooling And Manage Temprature. I give Star More ..1- Can\\'t find my TV 2- Won\\'t let me connect my devices to Google Home due to country restrictions.A bad application, very limited options for a very bad appliance.Works great for my dishwasher and I never care where my TV remote went now that I can use my android to control everything.Clear instructions on how to fix the problem! Thank you..I have some Error when I want to Connect to the LG TV invalid terms type for service.For A/C Turning ON/OFF based on room temperature is needed.Bloatware which requires location access and phone access to upload a program to a washing machine. Utter garbage..LG needs so many years to develop stable and friendly uses app. Work one time only then never work even I tried several mobiles Very very bad apps. Useless..All it does is crash on opening saying can\\'t connect to server.\"Cannot run on a rooted device\". Why?.Doesn\\'t support my top loader which says it\\'s got WiFi. Why would there be multiple apps?!.Great way to check on your laundry! Love it!.Works great, an app that does what it is supposed to do. Great job!.Cannot open . Force close after few second after latest update..Awesome! Love knowing the status of the washer and dryer!.Frequently shows an error message..Smart App, very informative diagnosis and found the problem aptly.So far so good! It was easy to connect and everything is running great..Usefull and functional, but unnecessary permission needed..Fantastic especially when laundry is out of ear shot.Great to be able to diagnose and remote start.Great app. Very helpful and convenient!.Nice plus to excellent appliances. Allows me to keep track of laundry when away from laundry room..Why does this app need access to manage and make phone calls???.A good place to start when troubleshooting your appliance..Confusing set up, but finally seems to work. Wish I could edit the settings for downloaded wash cycles.Very nice application...It controls any LG appliances that hold LG ThinQ ...Thanks LG.Wants access to my location, and to make phone calls both are not required for such... If LG wants to know my location it can just ask....It is easy to do easy to find what you need or want..Just starting to get used to the app with new washer. Seems to work well and is handy!.You can not edit washer/dryer program parameters. You can only choose from predefined programs and not able to create custom one..Easy to install and connect to the refrigerator.Note: I use this app with the wall heating/cooling. Conceptually, this app is super helpful. It simplifies many if the actions that would typically require the physical remote. However, there are a number of things that I want to do quickly and easily that are clumsy. For example, the app shows the temp of each room but not it\\'s current temp setting . For that I need to drill down one room at a time. When adjusting the temp, I can only tap the up/down buttons but want to type in the temp..my freezer got dumber and forgets settings after the upgrade.. thanks.. what is the point!.Tag on will not connect to NFC on android phone useless for diagnosis.See my review history The app only Adjust temp of fridge but not freezer. Turn on off hygiene Reports how many times door opened in your area. Update firmware. Provides diagnostics and stat to LG service. I have find out the hard way that LG is not standing behind own products. I received defective unit. No support from store, LG. LG collects personal info & equipment takes puctures and ignores the problem. Never see them again. That was 2nd product from lg and last. 1st LED TV needs 5 min.Dryer disconnected from app, now it won\\'t reconnect.App has been fine with my Washer, Dryer and TV. Today I received a notification ad for 15% off laundry detergent. I\\'m not happy getting ads in my notifications. If this keeps up, I will uninstall the app. I pay enough for your products, I don\\'t need to see ads in the app that supports those paid products, especially when those ads are in the form of notifications..Works very well. Great reminder when you have a busy life. Reccomend for sure..I can\\'t link this to the google home. It gives an \"Invalid terms type for service\".Contains ads. Already paid thousands of dollars for TV and appliances, now you push ads at me also? No way!.Works perfectly on TV and washer Diagnostic.Really cool. I like this feature of my appliance a lot. Few improvements: Wish the fridge would show more details about previous days energy usage and # of times door left open too long. Wish the dryer would show actual kwh for each completed cycle instead of just electrical symbols. Same with the monthly chart, it doesn\\'t show actual kwh in the chart, just a bar with no numbers. The washing machine won\\'t connect for some reason. Got my other appliances to connect fine, but that one won\\'t..Works great for my dishwasher to monitor wash cycles..No polish (PL) characters, no Google Home integration (regional lock).Waste of time just to read fault codes via microphone. Should take 15 seconds, not 5 minutes. Asked for location and phone permissions for no reason at first, and only asked for microphone after 1st audio diag had already failed. Abyssmal. Good idea though. The washing machine functionality is excellent. Implementing this to a mobile application failed hard. 0/5..Washer issue, helped diagnose, didn\\'t give options for fixing..Wifi works really good, laundry is cleaner and saves water too..Rather useless. The only thing I can do with this app is downloading a cycle and get a note that the machine has finished the job. None of the links work, when I need them. What I like to see in this app: 1) A page with a list of cycles. Thouch the cycle will start the machine. 2) A page with all options to configure the cycle of the day, with \"save to cycles\" option. A stard button ant the bottom. 3) Home page should list 3 buttons: A) \"repeat last cycle\" B) Start default cycle C) Time of star.No real opinion on app, but hate the Amazon advertisements. Didn\\'t spend x amount on this for ads..Great App. Love my new LG Appliances and TV.Before I can change the settings thru my phone, now it\\'s just diagnostics.The app still has bugs to work through for washer and dryer for example it does take a while for the remote access to trigger when it does trigger. What would also be a nice add to the app is there was the option to monitor the moisture sensor in the dryer that the user could trigger additional time or reset cycle or setting multiple cycles for a single load. I find large loads on very dry like comforters and blankets need an additional cycle with a sitting period so it doesn\\'t burn sometimes..Permission requirements are far too intrusive. Requiring complete phone permission just to set the country is a massive invasion of privacy. Just ask me what country I want it set to..It\\'s fine but I would love to start my washer from work but it\\'s not possible because the washer can\\'t be on the hole day so o can\\'t obtain contact to start the washer. And is useless just to use it at home from my phone.Won\\'t let me sign in. Doesn\\'t show in my installed progams..Seems to work rsther well. However, it is a pitty that the 12hour format is standard. Should be able to use 24 hour format..Really useful app, helps diagnose issues.One year later, LG still didn\\'t solve the problems with the app, instead, they used their time to add unwanted Advertising to this app. Keeps breaking connection with Google Home, it\\'s slow to connect, keeps losing connection with the AC units. It\\'s a real mess, I am really sorry I went with LG for my AC instead of some other brand..The iOS app told me that NFC wasn\\'t supported and that it only worked on Android, so I pulled out my Android device (OnePlus 6, up-to-date on Oxygen running Android 9; not exactly ancient AND has working NFC). Except this doesn\\'t have the option to use NFC. It doesn\\'t even mention NFC in the app when you\\'re getting ready to add a device. Disappointed, and functionally useless for my non-WiFi dryer. It shouldn\\'t be this difficult to access custom cycles..The only thing I noticed about the latest update is more ads from Amazon. If it\\'s working fine don\\'t update, going to contact LG about getting a return on the product I bought because of this. I guess collecting my personal data wasn\\'t enough, now I have to wait till all the ads load up before I can control my device..Hard to set up both washer and dryer then add another person to it. You start with the washer then when you get to the dryer you have to start over with a new app? Why? Once I got it I think it\\'s great. Everything makes sense. Just sucks you have to set up the appliances to use the app. It\\'s connected to WiFi already why do I need to do anything special? Girlfriend got frustrated and quit trying to set up the app.Signing in with google does not work. Wifi is on, the internet is working, and the other sign in methods appear to at least ask for name and password. Signing in with Google does nothing though except very briefly dims the screen and then about 3 minites later it tells me it can\\'t connect to the network..This app just spammed me in notifications to set up Auto Replenishment. I don\\'t want Auto Replenishment. There is no way for me to turn off notifications without turning off the most important notifications of when the washer and dryer have completed their cycles. I don\\'t want an app to notify me about ads they want to push. I don\\'t want \"offers\" in the app either..Since the latest bug fixes and the name change to ThinQ, it no longer works. It says my dryer is off, but I assure you that it is running. When it is actually off it says disconnected. It never says it\\'s on anymore. Same for washer and dishwasher. Should have left it alone. Edited: After uninstalling the products and starting over they now show up again ??. Now the washer is stuck in updating firmware..Cant get any \\'fantastic\\' remote functions started cos App hangs everytime when i tried downloading the top loader product info. I had turned off mobile data n connected to wifi, machine was on stdby mode. App does not work well on my husband\\'s iphone, it can\\'t get past set up stage. I\\'m using a note 9 so i assume new phone is supported. Lousy app with no tech support online so it\\'s hard to troubleshoot. App shd allow selection of product using drop-down list instead of d/L product info wholesale.very easy to use and extremely helpful.Not user friendly. We cant remotely turn on the washer. What a shame !?!.It was fine before, did what it needed to do. Now after an update there are push notification ads that you can\\'t remove. New permissions you can\\'t remove for reasons that are flimsy. Need call information to set my time zone? But that setting is within the app. Unnecessary. One star..This app gives you the option to start a load of clothes when your not home, let\\'s say while you\\'re at work or on vacation. The app doesn\\'t load the clothes, it doesn\\'t put detergent into the clothes it just starts the cycle and alerts you when it\\'s finished via cell phone. How did I make it this far in life without this ability. It\\'s not very useful for a washer dryer. It would be great for a robot -like a humanoid robot. You could give the robot instructions to whip up a batch of cookies..App is ok. We have a dishwasher, so there\\'s not much to say other than cycle finished and add rinse aid. I just wish it would allow me to select which notices we receive. I don\\'t care when the cycle finishes, but the rinse aid reminder is nice. Fix that and I\\'ll update my review..Terrible connection issues with Google assistant.This app cannot even let me configure the basics of my fh4g1jcs2 washer, only select preconfigured cycles. Unable to even change if I want steam or soil levels adjusted, or change temp. Not even saying that I want the chime off at night and there is no way to change that. Usually you would be able to do more with app than manually, this is just the other..Helpful tools for usage and maintenance.If i could give 0 stars, that would not be low enough for this application. Complete and total junk from beginning to end. My brand new fridge slowed up damaged right out of the box and i hoped getting this app set up and working would get the bitter taste out of my mouth, boy was i wrong. Device repeatedly fails to connect at 80% making the one biggest selling point for this product a complete joke. Would not recommend LG products or apps to my worst enemy at this point..Difficult to set up. No practical functionality with Alexa. It would be nice if the system allowed Alexa to broadcast notifications to its speakers. I revised my review to take into account that the recent washer firmware update appears to have eliminated the wifi disconnection issue...Working well so far for remote start and monitoring washes. Handy notification when wash is finished. Would be 5 stars if you could pause a wash for more than 15 mins, e.g. you get held up at work and want to pause for an hour but keep it occasionally turning, so clothes are not sitting around damp in the drum..The app works fine. Unless you want to connect it with Google ....If I could give it negative stars I would. I cant even log into my account to see if this app will even help me. I am second owner of a house with washer and dryer and I\\'m having issues with the dryer. Of course I dont have purchase date and location. But I cant even log in to diagnose my washer.It would be better if you would let me know when the washer is being turned on and when it is turning off as well. Sometimes it does sometimes it doesn\\'t. Ok.Permission to make phone calls? Permission to send Data to Amazon and other third parties? Permission to send and process data outside the EU? For an app to pop up a notification when the laundry is done? Seriously?.Needs more control options for NFC use..Why does this app need to share your personal data outside of the European economic area . If you don\\'t agree to this You cannot use the app and I did not set up the app because of this..POS THAT Sucks been downloading for the last 22mins so I\\'m on my tablet watching the s#it i wanted to watch on MY TV SCREEN same experience on every available Lg app slow installation.Poor WiFi installation for LG washer and dryer. The app\\'s SSID and documentation doesn\\'t match actual. You have to look at WiFi access points and manually select dryer\\'s SSID. WiFi password is double of last four hex digits -- e.g. 05FE05FE. Go back into app and hope it connects..Just got this recently, but I wasnt able to connect and remote the washing machine....Nice.. need to improve more on intelligent mode or download cycle.I\\'m not really satisfied with the app. Essentially it\\'s a notification tool that tells me when my laundry\\'s done. You need to make this more app friendly. Have options. Where hey I left clothes in my dryer let me start a wrinkle free cycle. There many different things that you can do to prove this app. Email me. We can chat and I show you innovation..Good! But could be better than this! Overall the app experience is good. But I\\'m only using it with the Washer. It\\'s good that only after enabling \"Remote Start\" manually from the machine, it can be controlled remotely. Not sure if LG could override this too remotely. It would be helpful to know the power consumption in Watts rather than as a symbol. Real time product based widget could be more helpful. Server maintainence could be known only after opening the app. Could use push notifications..I am using it for Air conditioner. Energy Saving Mode is not given. Temperature adjustment is required for scheduling which is not given. Swing can\\'t be shifted from 1 to directly 6th or required positions. Lot can be improved..Can\\'t turn on dryer with this app rendering it useless. Sometimes I want to add drying time once the dryer is finished but it automatically turns off and you can\\'t turn it back on with the app. LG IF YOU\\'RE READING THIS PLEASE FIX THIS AND UPDATE THIS APP!.Just stupid \"Ok Google ask lg to..... Ect ect¡± Why add the extra steps?!? Just causes issues, sometimes it doesn\\'t work when Google can\\'t talk to lg. Every other manufacture integrates better Google. I want Google to directly talk to the tv, not via lg servers..Poor excuse for an app. Always saying canceled cause unit did not respond. Try to set a repeat schedule for ac times and regardless of the times you selected it changes it and selects the time it wants. Ex. Set it to turn on at 7:30am and shut off at 4:30pm. It changes it to 8:30 to 5:30. No matter how many times I try to change it. And if I try to select a different time, it changes it to another completely different time. Garbage app waste of space on my phone..Meh. It covers the basics. It\\'s slow to update the status of appliances, usually telling me they\\'re offline first. Needs explanations of cycles. Is Bedding heavy blankets and duvets? Or is it sheets and pillowcases? Push notifications don\\'t expand to show additional information, like the time it was sent, so you can\\'t know if that note is for a new end of cycle or from one 2 hours ago that you forgot to dismiss. And I want to be able to set a clock start time since we pay time of use hydro..Push notifications sometimes work but most of the time do not. Everything was great until updates were made back in the early spring and LG can\\'t get it right. Adding this. Why does LG need access to photos, media files, and call history? You can\\'t upload anything to their app. It looks like data collection. If you have an issue, you have to call, email, and upload docs outside of the app. Reviewing cycle settings makes no sense. Simply, this is not a user-friendly app..Didn\\'t work. Twice I\\'ve been hit with a wall of water because I opened the door of my washer dryer combo and it had been filling all night even though the machine was off. The SmartThinQ could not find a problem, even though I ran the diagnostic three times. And of course we\\'re less than a month past the one-year warranty date. Very unhappy with my machine and with this app. The app also doesn\\'t identify the correct buttons to push. I had to figure it out..Can\\'t connect to Google home in Israel.Basically all this app seems to be good for telling me the time left in the cycle and notifying me when my laundry loads are done. It looks like I should be able to do much more with this app, like remotely operate my washer and dryer, selecting the cycle and etc, but neither my machine manuals, nor this app seem to have instructions on how I can use these features..Set up on my S9 plus was quite difficult to be honest. I ended up using a tablet that I had. Once set up though using the tablet I log into my phone and calls fine. Loving the app and my smart washing machine so far..Has nice description for error codes.Never works. TV is connected and on the same network as my phone. It worked one time only and that was it. Had this problem since end of May this year. So glad my main TV is a Samsung. LG would be better off stop trying to make TVs and concentrate on phones. My LG TV is nowhere near as good as my Samsung Qled. Actually not on the same continent. Get it together devs and make the damn thing work for a change..Created account online. Downloaded app.Says can\\'t find account. Created account on app. Sent email to verify my email address. Did not receive - several times. Troubleshooting: Check spam folder. I checked ... nothing there. Second step: use another email address. I ONLY HAVE ONE! Really, you want me to create another email address just for LG?.I have a new washer (WM3900HWA) and dryer pair and the washer does not hold it\\'s connection within the app. I have excellent WiFi signal and speed. The dryer stays connected no problem. But the washer shows as \"disconnected\" when it\\'s on and running every few days. It defeats the purpose of the app to see your cycle times when it is unavailable half the time. I\\'ve deleted and reset everything. THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE ON LG WEBSITE COMMENT FORUM. FIX THE SOFTWARE BUG ALREADY LG!!! IT\\'S BEEN MONTHS!.The app itself seems OK. I dont like that the WiFi shuts off on my oven and dryer when they are done. This means I cant tell them to run a little longer. Overall, though, in a big house, I like being able to know when my microwave dinner or laundry load is done. The ability to remote control these appliances isnt as useful because u have to go to them to \"load\" them in the 1st place. But u CAN put something in the oven and then start it cooking no matter where u are so it\\'s done when u get home..This app does not function well, if you\\'re lucky, and does not function at all, if you\\'re like me. Although the air conditioner that I installed the app for works well, the app is extremely slow and frequently shows my air conditioner as disconnected. If it actually says connected (rare), the majority of the time when I try to input a command to my air conditioner it says it timed out due to a long response time. Internet is 250mb download and 50mb upload (plenty fast enough)..You have to plan ahead to use remotely, if you forget to start a load you cant start it remotely unless you specifically enable remote start - which only lasts for one cycle. Washer keeps disconnecting from wifi and requires unplugging it to get it to connect again. Spoke to several people in Support and is of absolutely no help. They keep trying to blame my wifi even though I have 30 other devices with ZERO problems. It\\'s like they don\\'t even bother to test this stuff before they release it..My dryer is on and connected, but the app refuses to see when the appliance is actually on. Drier is running fine now: on, wifi light on, but the app says it\\'s off. Tells me I need to turn it on to do anything. *facepalm* The app worked for a day. Now won\\'t work. I reset the phone, uninstalled and reinstalled, still \"off.\" Fix this bug. I liked getting a notification when the laundry was done. . Day 2 of asking this get resolved..All in all, it\\'s marginally useful at best. Even though I\\'ve run the cleaning cycle on both of our ovens, I still get regular reminders to clean them both. Our refrigerator won\\'t stay online and now won\\'t even connect with the app. Our dishwasher randomly decides to error out, mid cycle, and the app is useless at telling me what is wrong, even when I try to use the diagnostic features. All in all, it\\'s pretty much a failure for our kitchen appliances..Works great for trouble shooting..Very helpful it sent me straight to the problem..After the update the app asks for login (I go through Google account) almost every time I start it, usually after wash end notification! Discovery/status of the washer is a little slow to check but OK. I like how the washer is not always online and goes off when done, the best security measure for IoT devices! Also one less thing for kids to fiddle with..App works OK, though it\\'s a bit slow. But I cannot connect the AC to Google Assistant, because \"the service is not supported in Poland\". What\\'s the point of these ridiculous, arbitrary restrictions? If the functionality is there, why block people from using it based on the country they live in?.I have a washer-dryer unit. It seems completely illogical that I can\\'t modify the options for a program (temperature, spin etc.) from my phone before starting the program. I can only do that manually, from the machine\\'s touchscreen. On the app every option is grayed out. I hope it is a bug and that it will be fixed. After that, I will change my rating..Pretty terrible app. No quick way to make the normal changes one would expect. It has a \"modes\" section which looks like it\\'s supposed to let you jump between common settings but it doesn\\'t work. There is no help out documentation so maybe I\\'m just doing it wrong but there\\'s no way to know. The connection to Google Assistant is nice but very basic. Certain features seem to be inaccessible via voice commands..worked fine untill today. maybe using the remote after turning it on with my phone app messes it up? it usually worked dine both ways but not today.it says my airconditioner is disconnected and when I try to reconnect it to wifi (holding mode+fan speed) it says \"please wait\" forever. UPDATE: ok I think by holding 5 sec on the remote control\\'s \"clear\" button, it allowed me to input the wifi password again and it is now connected. Update 2: ok it disconnected again a few days later. please fix it.Getting the washer and dryer set up on the WiFi is tricky, and the app has no IFTTT integration/capability. For the custom cycles, you have to pick from the custom cycles that LG has set up; you don\\'t get to create your own cycle, even if it\\'s pretty basic.On the positive side, the app is good about letting you know when a cycle completes..I\\'m constantly getting a \"can\\'t connect to server\" error when I open the and then it auto closes. However, I\\'m still getting updates on when my clothes are done. Only passively usable..I love the fact that when using this with my TV, it doesn\\'t pull up the keyboard within the app so I can type. This isn\\'t convenient, actually makes things harder!!.Useful app to diagnose issues..This app is unabke to connect with my washer. Customer service is very poor and unhelpful..Reasonably good app. The features presented are specific to each appliance. Some appliances have more features and controls in the app than others. This makes sense and I find the app useful. My only complaint is that push notifications come through whether I disable them or not. I really don\\'t need to know each time the oven is on and off..Set up my wall mounted air conditioner (heat pump) in about a minute. The app doesn\\'t have all the functions of the unit\\'s remote, but has the important ones, temperature, fan speed/swing, jet mode, as well as being able to set timers. A bit of lag compared to using the remote..Using app for remotely operating lg washing machine. Easy set up and no problems so far. Definitely convenient for getting one more load of laundry done during the day and also downloading more wash cycles, like pet hair and odor to get our pet blankets really clean!.App is worthless. Can\\'t get my smart oven to connect to my wireless. One of the reasons I bought this appliance and they can\\'t get the software to work. Stop trying to do everything for me and just give me an \"Advanced\" mode where I can type my wifi info in!!! Not hard and works in numerous other instances. ALSO, the app permissions are not necessary. If all you want to do is confirm location, ask me. Otherwise, stay out of my private life!.I really like this app. It tells me that IcePlus is on or off (I can turn it on or off in the app too). It just told me one of the fridge doors was not closed. I am in another room, so I went in to fix that. It tells me the status of the water filter, which is wonderful. I do wish its name started with LG so it\\'d be easier to find in my app library..Requires password every time it updates..Unclear on searches using specific words .....Useless app that doesn\\'t connect to anything..first it said it was registered successfully, now it says it\\'s not. nothing I do will get it to connect. I\\'ve read all the other reviews and I wish I could review the app, but I\\'m stuck at just trying to register. not good. UPDATE: Once I finally got it installed I appreciate being notified when a cycle completes. That\\'s really all I use it for, so far..complicated app. Most things need you to go to the washing machine so what\\'s the use of the app? At least remort start should be switched on from the app itself. Lots of improvement needed..Why in the hell does this app refuse to run without location and *phone call* permissions? All you need to do is communicate on the local Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Stop trying to be spyware. Your response that \"each permission is necessary\" is a poor attempt to dodge the issue. I\\'ll just return the appliance I paid hundreds of dollars for and go with some other vendor who actually has a clue how to develop privacy-respecting apps..I use this for the WiFi enabled ACs, and it seems to work pretty seamlessly. Changing the temperature or the modes from this app is super easy and the AC tends to respond within 2 seconds. With all the ACs WiFi enabled in the house, I can control them from sitting anywhere in the world. The energy monitoring feature is great, allows you to see the consumption over the day / week / month. If only they could show past months data too that would be good..With my AC, I can\\'t schedule it properly, the time keeps shifting when I turn it off and on, I can\\'t do a temperature range of when to turn on and off, it keeps putting the fan on high when ever I turn it on from the app and or switching modes. I\\'m giving this a 2 star only because I have some options but as an app, this is terrible. If I had known all these bugs were available, I would have not purchased LG smart products. Update: Oct 10, new update is now constantly crashing my ac app..Need some development in the apps store there is missing jio tv and apple TV and in the apps and there is no voice search option like Google assistant and not understand all commends in the remote voice search...otherwise great experience best 4k experience and best sounds and cute looking remote....Not working , so sad it came update while I\\'m travelling for one month planned to buy LG air conditioning Wi-Fi so I can control it from abroad. Was working perfectly until update , nw I can\\'t access the air conditioning 2 of them & cost a lot to buy each , all time i am trying to use the application,it says it\\'s disconnected!!!! I check my electric and my Wi-Fi router all working perfectly except the devices . I\\'m 7000 miles from home and by end of month the house will be so hot and can dist.Good app feels almost pointless for washer and dryer. You cannot remote start unless you press the control remotely on washer and dryer first and then after each cycle it resets and powers off you can\\'t even turn on the power remotely. You can power off remotely. It is really nice to get end of cycle notifications for both..Use this app for an LG window AC unit. It used to be great. Now scheduling feature doesn\\'t function at all because of a bug in their update. Have contacted LG multiple times, they don\\'t care. Definitely don\\'t buy this AC unit if you plan to use the app, you\\'ll be disappointed..Bro, this friggin app kept me from configuring the machines at the same time. A bug in the code only allows you to configure one machine at a time, which is to say, if my dryer is on and configured, my washer cant be configured, which is patently ridiculous. Please fix and I\\'ll throw the five star..Cant even get the app to connect to a new washer. All they do is blame my internet. I speedtest and try to connect with 3 different devices right next to the washing machine. All test at over 100mbps. And washing machine show its connected to my wifi when I use my Xfinity app. So it connects to my internet just fine but wont connect to the app and they say it\\'s not their fault? Just shows they dont care Was on phone for 2 hours. Was told their head tech would call me in 48 hours. Still waiting!.I connected my washer and dryer every time I click on the dryer. The app saying the dryer is not connected to the network or it\\'s off but clearly connected lt shows how much time I have left..Cannot change Wi-Fi network on my Air Conditioner. I have three PM12SP air conditioners and I wanted to change the Wi-Fi on all three of them. I managed to change the Wi-Fi a few months ago, but now it doesn\\'t work. Just tells me that it didn\\'t manage to do it. I can see that it connected to the LG wifi network during the operation, wifi icon on the air conditioner stops blinking and just lights, but all stays like that and in the end the app tells me that it didn\\'t manage to do it..Terrible experience! Can\\'t turn on the washing machine/dryer remotely, can\\'t customize the cycles, can\\'t link it to my google assistant, can\\'t add users to manage the machine. Basically, all this app can do is, notifying when a cycle is finished. Just feels like this app is pointless, very frustrating, I was expecting better from LG..Slow and simplistic. Doesn\\'t give you much info and doesn\\'t let you change most individual cycle settings. Cannot use Android adaptive battery optimization or you don\\'t get the alerts until the next time you unlock your phone. I would like more details on the appliance, like the MAC for the WiFi adapter.It was working great. I really liked it. However, the app was updated last week and no longer works. Very frustrating, and annoying. I cannot find any support contact for the not so SmartThinQ app. I have a few other LG devices, but if this is an indication of how LG supports its products I may stop using LG..Won\\'t get past account creation because keeps saying won\\'t comply with terms, but doesn\\'t explain specifics. Update to LG software team response: I have never rooted my Google pixel 1, running whatever updates Google pushes out..This is so frustrating. LG needs to start over and completely re-think this whole user experience..Either the wifi card and/or the firmware of the AC unit is buggy, or this app is, or both. Today I spent hours trying to re-connect it to wifi and for no logical reason it finally connected! The schedule function keeps moving a start and stop time one hour forward every time I turn it on or off. The temp is still being reset to 16C everytime I change cooling modes with the app from cool to energy saver and vice versa. Terribly buggy and it seems like the app, because it worked after a re-install..I love the app when it works. Occassionally it will say that my washer machine is \"disconnected\" when I\\'m standing next to the machine with a full wifi signal. Other than that, it\\'s a great app especially with our laundry facilities on a different level of the home..This is my first smart large appliance. I love it. Plus, the clothes come out super clean. I wish I could store more downloads on the washer itself. But, having the app is the next best thing..Amazing app helps with infomation of all LGs amazing products.You pay $1700 for a dryer that takes 2 cycles to dry your clothes, and then need an account to be able to even try to create a setup to make it dry in one cycle. If I\\'d known I would need to screw around with it this much I would of bought a $500 dryer from a differant company..Very convenient. Disconnected twice for an unknown reason, but so far ok. Now it is 10/28/19 and time for an update... The app almost always shows the washer as disconnected while the the dryer status is rock solid. Washer always indicates connected to wifi on the front panel, but rarely is connected to the app. Major disappointment. Lowering my rating..Great smart diagnosis app. When a machine is showing a code, you hold your phone to it and it will tell you what is wrong plus give you tips to fix the issue. Also, you can download new cycles to the machines and create your own cycles to download. Pretty cool!.OK as a stand-alone app. Does NOT allow my fully supported and new LG TV to connect to Google Home (I am UK based). App shows up but does not link. Functionality clearly has not been tested and TV is being sold with false advertising. It has options that suggest it should work with Google home via Smarthinq but hasn\\'t been tried/tested prior to release of app..Again with some stupid login. Dont want to create a new login or provide you with my google data. Just let me diagnose my washing machine without forcing loging in! Also you need access to my contacts, gps, sd card data etc ....even malware does not want that much permission...stop updating your app with bloatware and remove restrictions if i dont give you all my data!.Great App, I can control my LG ecosystem, I can control using my google mini.. which is definitely a great experience. I don\\'t see the option to connect my TV to be controlled from Google mini and I can\\'t turn on my TV using this app otherwise this app is an awesome app I\\'m loving it.. I use it and this makes me feel like I\\'m smart and I\\'m in a smart home.. thank you for the one who created this app. I appreciate it. But due to few bug\\'s like what I mentioned above, I gave 4 stars.. otherwise 5..I am havi LG freez. From last few days it\\'s not cooling. I have tried this app several times. Test result shows refrigerator is working fine. Cooling absolutely normal. So funny..Took a few attempts to sync washer/dryer. Seems to be working well. Have only had the set a week. Would be nice to be able to set a time when using remote start..1/ App is too slow and still loading; 2/ CZ IS OK NOW ; 3/ \"ENERGY MONITORING\" IS BETTER, NOW IT IS NOT ONLY CYCLE COUNTER, but i do not know what energy - kW/kWh/litres/??? 4/ not possible to set or change program after it is set to remote start.. app is only starter of the cycle + I use it only for notification of finished cycle.In app store, name is LG ThinQ. But once downloaded it\\'s call ThinQ. Why no LG? The UI for the AC remote function is not good. It mimic a normal remote which is not so smart. You have to click each time to increase/decrease temp by one at a time. Should allow user to scroll temp and fan speed then execute. Also, unlike the physical remote it lacks full fan speed control as it only have low/med/high which is 1/3/5 fan speed. It\\'s missing 2 & 4 fan speed. Option to save preferences would be nice..Its conveniently useful when you\\'re away from the home or at home completing other task. Knowing a cycle is complete and you when its available to start another load of laundry is awesome..I found that the TV only connect to 2.4 GHz WiFi network. I will require to open the app and connect to my TV then I will be able to control my TV but not when my phone connect to 5 GHz WiFi network. I have Google Mesh and it will do auto switch between 2.4 and 5 GHz network. My other products are on 2.4 GHz and while my phone is on 5 GHz but I have no problem to find those. My is LG OLED C8 model. It is new enough to have 5GHz WiFi built-in. Correct me if I am wrong..Lot of wifi connectivity issue, sometimes it show.my washing machine connected, sometimes it doesn\\'t. Also the download wash cycles should get permanently stored in the machine rather than a need to download Everytime. These downloaded wash cycles should show up on the app and we should be able to just select one of those cycles once downloaded and start the wash program..What is the point of using this app aside from monitoring it? You can\\'t even configure or change the settings! If I\\'m able to schedule my dishwasher and change the settings, then this application will be more powerful. This is why I\\'m uninstalling it..Instability, latest update won\\'t allow download cycles, slow to respond to commands or it says no network connection or the machine is disconnected. This app needs work.App works great, only down side is that my appliances work on 2.4 GHz and does not work with my Orbi for some reason. Managed to sort it out with a 2.5ghz extender..Excellent app to diagnose my refrigerator.The time left plus the notification when finished is awesome.I see that LG doesn\\'t read this!!! Reminder for tub cleaning should be persistent! Until done, not just once!!! Great to have option that it offers, but many could be added, eg switching the sound off! Why with all that functionality such a small, and very useful little commodity, was ommited?.doesn\\'t have compatibility with my portable air conditioner. don\\'t know why it has the smartthinq logo on my air conditioner is a R410a i\\'ve tried everything and the official webpage doesn\\'t have anything about the product still it is a lg product. i saw videos with the portable ac option but in this new app version i don\\'t see it. fix that please. 23/08/19 I haven\\'t receive any news about the AC and it still doesn\\'t connect to WiFi and I send all the info requested not even a reply than you..How do I turn off the stupid advertising that came with your latest update? I didn\\'t buy LG to get an ad every 3 seconds scrolling across my phone screen! Why can you not turn Bluetooth back off after you enable it for no apparent reason? Your programmers suck!.Great App! Has a great experience..App works well, especially when kids claim they turned the tv off before going out or bed etc But really need an option to not allow app to start Bluetooth, or unable to control, at least have the app switch Bluetooth back off when existing the app (unless another app is already using the protocol).Rediculious. A.C. unit schedule function refuses to save. Try to turn off at 1am and on at 6am or any other times the app changes the unedited time by an hour and saves the edited time to whatever but NEVER what you enter. After several attempts I gave up. The app WILL NOT SAVE SCHEDULE TIMES THAT YOU ENTER. Absolutely a waste of time and effort setting up. WORTHLESS..More service regarding information is needed in app.This has been happening for years now. What part of \"you are asking for a too liberal set of permissions for what you provide\" do you not understand. Half the time or actually almost always it is impossible to get even the.basic.functionality on this piece work..Why would an app for the range need to make calls, need my location or an account to use. LG needs to reevaluate its privacy policy. As we all become more enlightened with how corporations are selling every tidbit of information they collect, they risk alienating consumers. Count me as one. The app has been uninstalled & I\\'m regretting choosing LG..This app gets worse and worse with each update. My AC can\\'t use mechanical timers, so I was excited to see that there\\'s a wifi option. First the timer function kept randomly changing to hours off of what I set it to, now I can\\'t even see the interface. The user interface is just messed up. I wish they would fix it so I can make it actually work..Used to work perfectly for air con. Since last update just get error \"server failed to connect. No response from server. Try again later\".Overall a good way to monitor the progress of my wt7900 and dlex7900. It lacks the ability to modify way cycles such as soak or extra rinse, so it\\'s usefulness as a remote start is somewhat limited. The additional cycles to download from the catalog work very well..I absolutely love this app. Half the time I forget that I have started laundry, but with the app it sending me a message that clothes are either finished in the wash or dryer. Also I can start the washer or dryer using the app. After using this I want all my appliances to have this feature..Great fridge very user friendly.I am at a loss. What is this app for? The \\'tag on\\' instructions and choices are not the same listed in the manual. The manual says LG Smart Laundry. App looks like a 6 year old wrote it. Does nothing. When I tap to the washer like the instructions say. It syncs and downloads. But what does that do?. Nothing!.Used to work okay but now won\\'t let me sign in despite letting me sign in on the website, resetting the password. Then it tells me I have tried too many times and to sign in via email link which , of course, also doesn\\'t work..I didn\\'t care if I had wifi at first but I am now in love with this capability now. The app is very convenient when I\\'m busy as heck. I\\'m not wasting time running up and down 2 or 3 flights of stairs just to see if it\\'s done yet. Love it!!.Needs odd permissions, needs consent to ship your data abroad outside-eea, and then it fails to connect to the fridge. Also constantly shows ads for Amazon dash which doesn\\'t exist anymore?.I have a very bad habit of leaving stuff in the washer and dryer much to my husbands annoyance. That\\'s stopped since we upgraded our machines and I\\'ve been able to use the app. The only thing I don\\'t like is my phone does not have NFC so I\\'m missing out on some of the functions but it\\'s still a very useful app..Glitchy!!! I\\'ve tried several times to set a schedule for on at 7am and off at 8pm. It won\\'t lock in my time but makes up 2 separate on and off times. Currently, it\\'s stuck at 8am and 10pm, and this is through the app..App performs okay At first before patest update it would read that a door was left open on our refridgerator after one of us got the milk out or something as simple as that causing us to worry if we bought a malfuntioning unit But since update says more info like fan evap coil ,motor and such with check marks Hopefully one of those components malfunctions it will let us know.Only information is temperature and diagnosis for fridge/freezer. What about door opening, power usage etc. Not able to switch off automatic Bluetooth connection.Just brought the new signature fridge freezer and thought I was a good idea have the app connect to our fridge freezer..only to find no matter how hard I try to connect to it nothing seems to work..keeps saying failed connection..WiFi has no internet connection. TERRIBLE APP.Works well when it syncs with the air conditioning equipment, just a little bit slow to sync compared to other smart home apps like Hive and my cctv system. My company have installed many of the air conditioning units and its the same at all the other one\\'s I set up. Just a bit slow to sync. Would be 5 star\\'s if a bit quicker..When will this app reconnect to the server again!? Cool concept but not if I can never use it or add more appliances to it. Please fix!.Useful app but I don`r like that you can only use the app on the same wifi to control/access your appliance remotely like the washet/dryet when you are away from home..Doesn\\'t work with Alexa which is very disappointing and unclear controls on how to remove the remote from the screen when not using it..Easy to use and understand..Still sucks! And total BS response from the devs. Why can\\'t i turn off Locstion and media access to the app after initial run?. You don\\'t need that ongoing unless you are stealing data!.App updated 2 days ago and now today it won\\'t open, says \"Cannot run on rooted device\". My phone is not rooted! Fix your app! No IFTTT Support, Alexa integration is worthless! I\\'m about to take this washer and dryer back and get Samsung..Why is it not working anymore? I bought LG because of the convenience of remote control thru wifi. Now app always says Server Not Found. It used to work smoothly for a few weeks only. Please fix! Disappointing and not convenient anymore..I\\'ve the latest SmartThinQ update installed and the Normal and Download cycle options both deny me the ability to change the wash temperature (for cycle Downloads all changes are denied). Modern detergents claim they work equally well at lower temperatures with reduced energy costs and less environmental detriment. Also your default of 40c is too hot for most woollens!! So in SmartThinQ why do I not have the option to choose a lower temperature? Please can you answer my question LG?.Annoying app. I dont mind the in app ads, but the notifications for these ads, that you can\\'t turn, off is uncalled for. Now I have to turn all notifications off when not doing laundry to prevent the interruptions. Plus why in the world do I need a history of the washer/dryer usage?.I have had to use this twice to fix a loud fan noise and both times it diagnoses and fixed the issue instantly. Love this app..works after a lot of effort..It tells me when the clothes are done yet somehow I have done laundry without this feature for years.1.It can\\'t be used unless you to turn on the machine and click on a button in the panel, which will later pair up with the phone and starts to work 2. Wash cycles can\\'t be customised Only benefit is, it\\'ll notify once the wash is over!.R9 Master needs My Zone maps that can be edited as hallways and bedrooms are seen as one space and I want them independently selectable for cleaning. No areas in My Zone (Do not clean) can be selected. Since latest ThinQ update start and finish times in Cleaning Diary are out by 1 hour e.g. shows 7:30am instead of 8:30am. Time in Notifications is correct i.e. it will show 8:30am.I like the notifications when a load is done but I wish I could use the remote controls without having to turn it on manually each time..Spent extra to get the \"smart\" oven to preheat from work so it\\'s ready when I get home. Only to find out to preheat via the phone I literally have to press a button on the oven and open the oven door to grant access to the phone to select preheating. I may as well just preheat it myself instead of going through those steps. What\\'s the point of advertising this feature if you need to be there in person to operate the oven just to turn it on with my phone? So misleading. SUPER disappointed..this app works good the only thing it needs to have 5 stars is to have the option to turn off the display light on my AC, the remote control has it so I don\\'t think it would be difficult to have it in the App..Useless. In order to add appliances you have to login to your LG account. It does not recognize my LG account even after verifying via desktop and resetting pw. Part of the reason we bought these units was for programmability... Which has to be through the broken app..Update 9/5/2019 Nice edit screen added moved to 3 starts we need costume mores now please and direct wifi connection for faster response lots of missing feature we need more customizable modes to controlore that one AC at once. UI IS VERY BAD update. still missing custom mods and widget also an option to organize the ac location in the UI to sort by name or custom order..Now everytime I restart my phone my custom sounds for the apps notifications are set back to the apps default sound of 121090 (whatever that is) . No other app I have custom sounds assigned has this problem. Must be something with the apps initialization sequence. Very frustrating..You cannot use it unless you allow LG to track your location and have access to operate and configure your telephone, including \"make calls\". It is a shame because the app, without the extremely intrusive permissions, is quite nice..Good to track status of your LG appliance...I use it for my dishwasher. But wish you could do more like - schedule a delayed run, turn on night dry option, etc. At present it gives me real time data on the dishwasher run status which is good, don\\'t get me wrong. But maybe I expect more!.\"SERVER CANNOT CONNECT\".Wow awesome application am very happy it works with me.Limited features. I have a washer and dryer. I cannot start a laundry load directly from the app. It has to be done on the machine asks them remotely started. Also the notifications are not working all the time..Very basic, IoT is stretching the truth a little. Basically no integrarions beyond ultra basic voice control. LG you need to open up APIs to your appliances to make them truly IoT capable, this closed approach with only major players will keep you behind in the market..Nice app but could be great I should be able to see my fridge real time temps without needing to run the diagnostic. Also I should be able to start a dryer from the app so I can just add more time without first having to tell the dryer I want to use the app in the beginning..Waste of time. Can\\'t even modify the downloaded programs to set things to \"cold water\" on a washing machine. Certain people in the household don\\'t like pressing the cold water setting 4 times every single time. This would\\'ve been easier, but no.Notifications when my washer or dryer finished a cycle? Nice. Advertisement \"notifications\" for crappy deals on supplies through Amazon? That can\\'t be turned off? No. Just no..I love this. Only issue is the annoying need to flip to remote mode to use mobile. Is there some default which can be changed? Can\\'t find it :(.Great app very easy to use and sync to my phone. Love the product. My first LG appliance and I am impressed.Application is simple and the premise is good, but notifications from the machines do not come regularly or promptly.Nice app but make it more user friendly..Fails to connect past 30% using NFC. Phone is a Pixel 2 with no case on and NFC is turned on. Phone is held in the proper place and doesn\\'t move during the attempt. Cannot add appliances. Models WM4270HVA and DLEX4270V..Fantastic App. My phone manufacturer disabled screen mirroring for some strange reason? this app enables me to share my photos, videos etc without having to go out & buy a Chromecast - also control\\'s the TV great, but I prefer the magic remote ??.I was using this app, but recent update broke it. Now it says \"Cannot run on a rooted device\" even though my device is not rooted. And even if it was, it would be a stupid requirement..Finally after over 1 year of use and you\\'ve nailed it. Works as I expect it to. If you\\'re facing issues delete app and reinstall. Hopefully it stays fixed now. 2 X TV, Washer Dryer, American fridge and AC. All functions working as they should.Awesome app. Not only does it have extra setting I can download to my washer and dryer for those special materials, but it also can diagnose any error code and tell you how to fix them..Now it is not working after the update and always showing \"Server failed to connect\", rectification is urgently needed please..Your bug fixes didn\\'t fix the scheduling for the AC. You\\'re app is costing myself and probably others money. Can\\'t have this AC unit running all the time and with the scheduling I can turn the unit off for certain hours of the day or night..App has some useful features but I expected more. E.g. the energy monitoring doesn\\'t work, also it takes very long to display the status and sometimes failes completely. Wifi is good, cannot be the reason..I dont think i have any home apliances conmatible with this i was just curious of what it was But the app itself just keeps looping between the turms and the acoune signup aplies screen When i select all it says ive already signed up Idk whats going on.Great app to control and oversee usage & air quality but could improve more showing size of area polluted or also include data from outside pollution..Smart useful apps for checking lg 16kg washing machine..This smart appliance is better than all of my previous conventional ones.Can\\'t connect it with Google home.I can\\'t find option to add my Hom-bot cleaner. Can anyone explain me why please?.Love this app. I can control the tv and monitor my washing. No need to go to the laundry just to check when your cycle is going to finish, it\\'s all at your fingertips..It refuses to run on my device, and requires far too many permissions. There must be a third party or PC app somewhere. This sucks. I should use stronger words than that..Eversince the update the instantaneous power consumption is not displayed. It will show as a fraction of the actual power. Previously it used to show the correct value always which i have verified with a clamp meter..Why is a rooted device a problem for this app? It\\'s not exactly a banking or identification app. Please remove this..Buggy Nagware. I have to reregister my washer every time that I use this app and then it tells me that it\\'s already registered at which point it reappears. And then it demands I enable location services which I lothe doing. I might have bought a different washer if I knew I\\'d be nagged all the time to change settings. Wood not recommend..My SmartThingQ TV can\\'t be linked to my Google Home, when I try to set the device up, it seems to be linking my account and then it doesn\\'t do anything but back to \"Setup new device on Google Home\".Nice to be able to check status and turn on and off remotely. However, even after the current update, there are still significant glitches in the scheduling system..Love the app for my washer and dryer. It lets me know how far along they are and when they are done. It\\'s hard for me to hear the melodic chime, and it sets off my phone notification when it\\'s time to switch out the clothes..Nothing real special. Using the dishwasher it allows me to see how long is left, etc.. just stays. I am not capable of turning it on, off, making adjustments or control settings. So pretty much it\\'s good for notifications. That\\'s about it....I like being able to change temperature settings, control ice maker to increase production, and being notified when the door is left open. Also like being to run troubleshooting to get feedback on acceptable temperature, overall performance etc....The app is good, but I will give 5 star once it will have following feature- While using washing machine, user should get a custom option where he can choose time involved in different steps like rinse, washing and spin..We only have an LG Smart dishwasher but is great having it communicate when it is finished or when it is running low on drying agent. Makes me want to upgrade our other appliances to work with the app as well..Superb app to diagnose your device.Could not control water temperature.App works fine and looks good. I would like to see a description of what the washing machine cycles will do, for example spin speed, water temperature and duration..App keeps forgetting degrees celcius on air conditioners. Missing device functions such as clean air, plasma etc..Useful but laggy/slow, with the washer sometimes not being seen properly at all since the last update..Love it. Easy to understand & I am a 68 yr old senior. No problems figuring it out at all..I like the app but a lot of times when I enable the ice plus on the app the switch goes back to ice plus off! It\\'s really frustrating! Then I don\\'t know if ice plus is really on or not!.Easy to use and lets me know when my wash is done. Allows for remote start and ability to set up which cycle I want to use. Very user friendly and handy for those who are multi tasking household chores..The app quite often fails to connect to my devices; claiming the wifi connection has failed. But every other (non LG) device works just fine; and trying 20 times will usually resolve the issue....Pile of rubbish my Alexa will only pause volume up, volume down TV off and every command is \"Alexa ask at to ask TV/comand\" first,.This app is a time waster. It cant connet the wash machine.Easy to use great experience..This is not a user friendly app at all. No real options and in order to use the downloaded features you have to remove any case from your phone. Needs serious updating. Had i looked at the app prior to purchasing. These units i would have probably gone with another Smart Washer and dryer.So much easier than being on hold w Customer Support for an hour. The app was fairly simple to install and the instructions made sense the first time. Many thanks..The app works well with our new washing machine. Unfortunately it doesn\\'t install in icon on my phone so I have to go Play Store>Open to run it. Very frustrating..Great idea, bad execution. The \"SmartThinQ is running now.\" notification cannot be swiped away. Android 10 on a Pixel 2XL. There\\'s no reason I should have to force close the app to get rid of that notification..Only way to turn on washer is by unplugging and doing hard reset using power then start buttons each for 5 secs. This app says everything is perfect on ours.... so not effective. After watching youtube seems to be the mother board.It works. No problems yet...I have a LG TV , LG Washer and Dryer..This app is pretty much useless. Sure, you can see if the machine is running, but you can\\'t do something as simple as ask it to dry a load, even when it\\'s finished washing. It\\'s just sad..I was super happy with this app,simple,did what i needed, but ever since the last update i did last week i cant even open the app, it closes itself im unable to use the wifi function of my a.c. , so anoying.Easy setup application working great.Easy to use, great results!.Excellent app and very user friendly.Application still has an old UI? reverted from new UI. Latest update installed, very strange... contacted developers email without any response. What is the point of having a contact when no one replies..Remote control needs to be on all the time. This requires manual activation. I get it protects from IoT hack attacks but should be an option if you want it..Love the app for our TV and washer. Only time I wish it had was a notification for when you were close to needing to clean the machine. Please add this feature..Cannot get the dryer to register.....Good interface to interact with LG wireless devices , live status of device (Temperature,Timer).Cant connect to server. Issue persist for more than a week. Disappointed.Love it,its so bigger then the other one.Very slow app. Takes several seconds for it to connect to my AC to be able to control it. Third-party apps like Alexa controls it much faster..I need help with this, when opening the app I keep getting \" Server failed to connect \" message. I want to add another device but cannot get into the app.This app really sucks. Impossible to use if your WiFi network ssid has any sort of special characters. My ssid name is hidden for security reasons and the app does not have any manual setup method..A little convoluted getting synced with our LG product (refrigerator) but having done it once it will be straightforward next time. Great to see usage stats benchmarked to average appliance by all customers/owners.Gives incorrect diagnostic information. Showed an AC system was gassed when it had zero gas in it..Analysis and gives good valuable information about the system to the user..This app is easy to install and use!.Not always working properly. When I try to put on shabbos mode, or take off snacks more, it doesn\\'t respond....I also wish there was a way of seeing what\\'s inside the frig ehrc I\\'m out at the grocery... That would really be SMART!.in the last update they added a requirement to log in, but when you try to log in, it fails with an error. deadend.A bit slow to connect and difficult to set up and get running some of the notifications arrive late but hopefully they will be able to fix this, overall 8 out of 10.The reasoning for the call permission is ridiculous. There\\'s no reason this app should be requesting it. They claim it has to do with localization settings, but that has absolutely nothing to do with the phonecall permission..A very convenient app to use. Especially if you always have your smartphone in your hands, you can manipulate every appliance in your house..This app has a ton of bloat, and barely does what it is intended to do. Now, I\\'ve started getting notifications from it telling me how to get deals from Amazon. And their notification management is a POS..Now has notification ad spam with offers on laundry detergent deals from online stores but does not categorize the notifications differently than notifications about laundry being done..I love this app. I now have an LG dishwasher, oven, washer and dryer. This app works great for all of them!.Very good tells me when my eashing machine has finished washing my clothes thanks!!!.So slow... Slow... Takes forever to load.Needs to show current temp, not just set temps of fridge. Interface could be better; especially when fridge has been disconnected from wifi and needs to be reconnected..Intrusive Permissions. Claims it needs location access and needs to view my phone logs for utterly spurious reasons. No LG, you do not need these things just for an app to monitor the fridge. So what are you using them for?.Very slow. Extremely basic functionality. No integration with other smart home systems. Other than that, works fine..It\\'s a straight forward design and it\\'s fairly well done. Three stars for the adds about Amazon. Having a feature is awesome, pestering me for it is not..Dryer with auto sensing always finished each load too early, downloaded this app to run diagnostic but turns out everything is fine, not sure if I need this app for any other reasons..This app is dumb. Can\\'t create a completely custom cycle for my washer / dryer where I control every setting so maddening..Says cannot connect to server.After the 9/30 update changing AC modes still sets the temperature to 60 degrees and the fan speed to high automatically. How has this not been addressed yet..Works well for what it does. Nice to be able to download addtional features and/or settings for appliances..I like that it tells me when a cycle is done. For some reason I am unable to start the wash from the app... otherwise it would be 5 stars!.I used to use this app with my front load washer. I rooted my device and now it refuses to run just because my device has root access. Why? Just because, apparently. Why would you do such thing?.Poor Heatpump support. Constantly failing to connect, reinstalling everything and failing. Worked a couple of times in total. Extremely frustrating..Worked with google home for a week. Now it just connects and disconnects. Off and on. Never settling for either. Tv.Easy to use and helpful.Excellent app, very easy to use. Very helpful with your full fledged Wifi, I am using my Refrigerator & Washing Machine. Life is totally Good..!!.This app runs my new washing machine. Notifies me when its done and everything. I\\'m so impressed. It also has a remote control for my TV. Works great..Push notifications inaccurate. Using the app, I\\'ve remotely run a tub clean cycle each month of ownership yet the app still nags me every 30 cycles about never having run a tub clean cycle..Good to i form when finished cycle. But that\\'s it. Nothing else. Other feature are redundant in my opinion..App needs work . Would rate 0 if it was possible . Hard to get washer and phone to link up. Poor guidance in app. Needs to be much clearer on exactly how to connect..Good for error diagnosis, however to operate the machine from mobile, it still requires you to go to the machine and press remote start which a bummer..Easy to install app. Connection was quick and easy. No problems at all..I bought an LG dish washer. It is awesome that I can always see the status of the cycle so I can know when to put away dishes..Can\\'t set timers for air conditioner. Don\\'t buy one of their \"smart\" air conditioners if you plan on programing it with this app..Useless: the app won\\'t let me sign up - I\\'ve tried sending authentication to my email twice and nothing has come through. (Yes, i checked the spam.).Poor network connection with phone and dryer/washer. Can\\'t detect half the time. Has potential but needs better consistency..My fridge quit working but when I run the diagnostic test it says it\\'s working fine. Obviously that can\\'t be true do I\\'m my case it\\'s not worth downloading..It will be perfect is the schedule function able to set Operation Mode and Fan Speed with dates or daily or weekly..Nice app. I would like also to show me how to operate the machine using the celphone even i am at the living room. Hope there\\'s a way..I like the app because it tells me how much time is left in the cycle but I wished I could change the settings on a cycle as I can on the machine itself..Love the notifications of finished washing cycles. Though an open platform would be preferrable as appliances from other brands need seperate apps and this does not simplify life....So convenient! I\\'m like that it notifies me when a cycle is complete..Cannot connect to the Google assistant app to enable me to control my TV..I thought I would be able to change settings on my product but it only gives me status and shows current settings. Manual makes it seem like you can make adjustments but you can\\'t..The notification that the washing load is done is great but it\\'s supposed to be able to be powered on from my phone and that feature doesn\\'t work.App keeps crashing when opening with last update. Still getting push notifications. Android 5.0.2 Update 10/8: Todays update appears to have fixed issue..I have LG Account but it\\'s not working in SmartThinQ App, showing that ID or Password is incorrect, but it\\'s working perfect in Chrome or web and even in PC, but it\\'s not working in this App.Lousy -- Unreliable. Always says my washer and dryer are turned off. This app is useless..Does not register washing machine, multiple attempts of calling for assistance produced no resolution. Don\\'t waste your money on LG products. Customer service is worthless..Not bad!! Has potential to be great. Needs to be faster when updating product status..Love this app. Tells me when my dishes are done. When to add more spot free rinse..Google home is now supporting LG wifi enabled AC, i can turn on AC via Google assistant and even set temperature also..Forces you to share location when you are not using the app.Helps me keep track of filter changes.Worked once. Now won\\'t connect to my TV again. Seemed like it was going to be a good app. Very disappointing!.After use of 6 months, since I haven\\'t been found mosquito option. Developer\\'s kindly notice and provide as soon as possible..Schedule functionality keeps adding an hour every time you make a change or cycle schedules on/off. Super annoying to try and get times correct..It\\'s slow, turns on my Bluetooth for no reason, and it uses GPS in the background..Very stupid app, no English in wash menu. Cannot start the remote session. Regret of buying LG, should have go with Samsung despite smaller load..Frequently shows the device as off when it is not. Good when it works. Unreliable..All settings are lost after update, which meams i have to pair the appliances again. The app on iphone crashes after login. Looks like the smartness is more of a gimmick for lg..The washer\\'s wifi is always disconnected after a wash. Hope u guys could solve this. Thanks..Does not support Google Home Assistant in India..A beautiful UI that does nothing... Does not allow me to download new cycles to my dishwasher for no explanation..Not a lot of use. No real functionality. Can not set things like \\'spin only\\' manually. Pretty pointless really..Totally broken since name change. Can\\'t access or link the washing machine at all now :(.Just add already Google Assistant support for all countries, why is it so hard ffs (65C9).Works great and easy to use.Inappropriate and unnecessary permissions required Update: LG could simply ask you for the information they want instead of trying to take it from behind your back . BTW there are no privacy regulations that require LG to know your age if they just don\\'t collect your personal data. The app could simply ask you what country you are in. There are ways to know if enough free space is available without invasive permissions. What will LG do with all that access in the future? They will monetise it..Pointless app... Confusing set up with oven, remote start? How about just checking on the status of oven and meat probe? Nope..Going smarter everyday with the help.of this new app which is good to know even the smallest details that an average day joe won\\'t be able to know. Good service app..Why does it need permissions to receive and make phone calls? Not very many options in the app either..It tells me that everything is working. But it hasn\\'t been cooling in five days.Very Good App for my new LG Fridge..Missing an adaptive icon. Assistant integration should not be limited on certain countries, want to use it in Colombia..You really need to work on this, it\\'s very random sometimes works sometimes doesn\\'t, I understand it\\'s not easy to make an app work and make it secure but come on lg you\\'re multi millionaire!!!!.overall good, but if a door stays open the app won\\'t tell you. there should be an upgrade to make that happens..Good app, NEARLY perfect.... LG please make the schedules function work with a time setting not just preset hourly intervals. Then it\\'s a 5 star app!.Great app, at least I know what is going on with my appliances. Thank you LG making life good..Could not add LG smart TV even with good wi -fi. Both app and tv connected to sing wifi router of 2.4GHz. App fails to search device..Awesome app! Easily connected to my washer. Now I can remotely start laundry, and notifications about finished cycle are very handy.Nice experience , this app got me all the problems that my refrigerator was experiencing. And now my product is working well . THANKS LG !!.Weather is the only useful thing? :) cant see current fridge temperature and it cannot notify me when door opens/closes... basically app is useless for fridge....Don\\'t working at all. All time say Server failed to connect..Breaks if not given location and phone call permissions. No, you don\\'t *need* either of these to work. They might provide an improved experience, but there\\'s no reason they should be required..Might be the slowest application in existence. Does LG run their entire \"smart\" infrastructure on a Raspberry Pi? Takes almost a minute to to \"Check Product Status\" and I might as well walk over to my appliances at that rate..Works fine. Level of detail great. Controls everything just like remote. Thumbs up!.Saved me money using smart diagnosis. Just lock the fridge and have the app ready then hold it near when you hold the freezer button to make the noise.App is to monitor and control appliances, but a third of the main screen is taken up by the weather. This information is not relevant to managing my appliances..Location and call logs. Just why. Call logs are unnecessary and you can have the location just once, why have it every time!.To much information and permisions requested for a washing machine app. Also, I need an account to wash my clothes??? If you\\'re stuck with LG jusk find an old apk, somehow LG\\'s hunger for private data is recent..Need to have full control/make your own cycles etc from the app, also Google needs to be able to pause..I like the AP to show me when the door was left open. The ability to get warnings is great!.Nice IOT app. Would be better if it showed basic status and logs of things too like compressor on times, door open and close times, etc.Uncompatible with google assistant, check the location, completely nonsensical!.Smart Application, really helpful application.Wow, an app that makes it harder to do a job than without..A bit slow but since I\\'m loading the dryer, I can set the drying cycle manually without having to open phone and then set the dryer settings..The worst app I\\'ve ever installed. Doesn\\'t reliably connect to the washer and dryer. Confusing to use and feature poor..Really could use the product versions listed in app. Told me to replace water and air filter. Go in app and have no idea what product codes I need or even what model the fridge is. If you are going to let me know, at least let me know what to order..App has made me to enable geolocation \"for better wi-fi detection\" although I only needed to add a \"tag on\" device. Better wi-fi detect my ass you spys!.It could have been helpful if one can turn on or start the dishwasher with the app..Very intuitive app!.Absolutely love how this app can diagnose problems...it comes in so handy and most of the problems are easily fixed.. highly recommended.Acceptable, I would like to be able to see the current temperatures. If this is an option, it is not easy to locate....very useful app to determine if there\\'s a problem to my washing machine so i can avoid it..Log in tricky as I\\'m new. Tried using LG account, NOT recognized. Tried Google next, off & spinning. Very handy..There is no button to advance past the Wi-Fi setup for washers or dryers. Cannot connect either to my phone..1 feature I like most that LG TV PLUS app can\\'t do (yet?) .... This app can TURN ON my TV. And for that feat, this app deserves 5 stars..Broken apk aftet last update. How the hell you can breack something with an update .. wait yes you can do that with development done via low cost. Thank you for taking my money..Amazing app to diagnose with. Would recommend it !! Thanks LG. Never cease to amaze me..We have a washing machine, a dryer and multiple air conditioners and they all work great within the app and with Google home.Sends notifications when your laundry is ready! I love this app, very easy to use..Can give 5stars, if We control, program the LG dishwasher through this application, change and restart options and so, Can be improved in future,al the best. Regards.Notifications work for the dryer but not the washer. I can\\'t find any information about troubleshooting the app for notifications..Pretty much useless app. Do not pay any premium for connected appliances..The fact I need to install this to troubleshoot is in of itself a design flaw. Just to harvest data..Dishwasher keeps turning off, and ThinQ shows all system checks good?.Unable to set washing parameters of a program (temperature, steaming, speed of spinning,...).This is a really great app for our most it used appliances; dishwasher, washer & dryer..After update, It says can not run on rooted device, but my device is not rooted..The lack of ability to add multiple household members without having them all log into the master account is super lame..Excellent app push notifications are awesome when I forget laundry in the dryer and firmware updates and notifications let me know LG is still actively servicing these units.So easy and functional.My washing machine just died and went black after trying to set a custom cycle with this app, luckily it came back on after a few minutes but I don\\'t know if I\\'ll use this again :o.As a Smart TV the app is faulty better use LG TV Plus app As a washer i loved how accurate the smart diagnostics feature is.Need lot Improvement.this app hang after adding devices such as ceiling fan. pls fix it early as possible..So, I can install the app on my android phone but not my android tablet...once i do install it on my phone the first A/C i add gets stuck on firmware update.Can\\'t use special characters in your wifi password. So basically LG wants you to make your wifi unsecure so you can wash a load of laundry..LG washer never works. Either it doesn\\'t stay connected or I can\\'t even connect to it in the first place. Buying washer because it\\'s smart but never being able to connect to it isn\\'t smart at all.Doesn\\'t even work after last update and now pushes annoying ad notifications. I already paid a lot for the washer and dryer, but gotta get more profits. Uninstalled. Jerks..Washer is on a separate floor... cannot always hear when it stops... reminder is great!.So far so good and I enjoy it. Only wish there was a dark mode...can\\'t give 4-5 stars otherwise.When your laundry machines are in the basement, the alerts come in handy. I also like being able to check the status of my load..I can\\'t even use it because my only device is rooted and TV asks login in app and not allow login inside TV..Love this feature always been correct so far.Unusable on rooted devices. Crashes on a non-rooted pixel phone as well..Haven\\'t used it since 1 year, now I bought a new dryer, functions and usability improvements visible. Keep it up.Work good but hard to hook up wifi.Missing \"next\" buttons in washer setup so I cannot add my washer. Will amend review after this is corrected..Very helpful and saved us money on repair fridge just needed to be reset!.Horrible app, unreliable. LG heatpump schedule config is just mad. The config figures change randomly..Very temperamental trying to get appliances to connect. Spotty performance on cycle finish push notifications..This app seems to be SMART but its has lots of bugs errors while connecting to appliance..Convenient and simple.. Not very useful for day-to-day use with my range. It just takes up an IP address.Why the heck does this block me from running on a rooted device? What type of nonsense is this?.Works great... Able to download new washer programs and adjust rinse aid amount used... Lets you run diagnostic tests also... Worth using the program.Very nice wish you could control dryer to keep warm.Great app but I want to be able to schedule my on and off times it got buggy 2 updates ago.. I want to contact Lg and let them know..Very good and easy to use app.it is easy now to wash clothes with this app..Worst app ever ask you to update and every time you update you have to go back through the whole process to reset everything up again it\\'s not worth it.Setup is a pain because the scan and connection to the network kept timing out..Unable to have multiple users getting notifications for 1 washing machine. A very stupid limitation..Great app however it Should be able to power on the appliances as well..The loading is pretty slow. I guess their server is too slow or too far away..Can\\'t even use it with a rooted device? Guess I won\\'t be using the app after all, infact I wonder what my return policy is for my washer and dryer, may trade in for Samsung since I have the time and money. And if LG won\\'t let me use their app why let them use money? I also have trees that tipped over during a storm, I should chop up roots with a chain saw and clog the machine with it, and when its returned to you for \"not draining soap\" you\\'ll be taking apart a rooted LG device..Great for my dishwasher. Very informative and helpful. Easy setup.The app took a little while to load but all in all good app..Very helpful in keeping my washer healthy.Very handy for keeping track of compatible appliances..Was working well, now it can\\'t connect to server.Most of the times i cannot connect to my tv..You need an LG account on top of *all* the permissions there are to use this app. Uninstalled.Our ref doesnt have a control panel and touch screen but it did manage to help us through it..App was able to inform me of the problem saving time and money..Great app, incredible time saver for diagnostics.Great for remote monitoring.Helpful alerts. Would be helpful if you could turn the dryer light on from the app, easily.Love this spp! Helps me to understand how to fix my problems witj this machine.??.Very usefulb n user-friendly app invented by LG for its latest technology electronic House hold gadgets..Super app enabling control and diagnosis of LG home products.Does what it\\'s meant to without any hiccups.Oh Lord. Since update, will not accept my password. Try to reset password and it will not let me set the password TO THE PREVIOUS PASSWORD!.Thought this was more of a gimmick, but have to say, I have come to really appreciate the phone alerts and other features..Power saver option should be added. The app should be expected a little bit faster.Great app to monitor my LG refrigerator and to activate extra ice or change Temps... Easy to use.Can\\'t even login, tells me it has an error always.Cannot run on a rooted device. FAIL..Not able to connect using tag. It keep on giving me registration error..\"Cannot run on a rooted device\"...why not?.Make and manage phone calls to identify the country? Permission denied, would like to identify the country manually, but alas the app just shuts down.. fix?.Yes, kind of hard to get connected, but once it\\'s done, it\\'s done..Fridge wasn\\'t cold and the self diagnostic told me the freezer door was left open so the unit stopped cooling, nice to know i dont need a repairman.Automatic logging out. N super slow app..Stopped working Cannot find ac devices.Great app, sorted the problem after running the diagnosis.No Response from Server? What a Time Wasting APP. Not surprised! Deleted APP!.In my country, we use celcius instead of fahrenheit. But it is showing ¡ÆF with wrong value.Can\\'t use if you don\\'t allow transfer of data outside EEA.I see no reason to block rooted devices. Lame decision on the part of the developer..Cool tool. Would be 5 stars with deeper summary stats or ability to download the data..Doesn\\'t actually do a ton, but the novelty is interesting.Fantastic app it works fine and also connected to google assistant , thanks to LG.Can\\'t change language settings. I downloaded English but the app is in Japanese..I am unable to login. In Desktop I am ABLE to login..Fail! Cannot run on rooted device?? My phone is NOT rooted. IdiotThinQ..The option wifi connection is good, but we need to enable remote start manually every time to initiate washing. Can we also make it auto?.Great app for my front loading washing machine.. Easy and convenient.Wi-Fi AC is good but want to add more function.It never works it always tells me it can\\'t connect to the washer even though the washer is on and the internet is stable.This app was awesome until it start advertising for me to buy from Amazon ????..Sends advertisements to your notification bar with no way to opt out..Can\\'t connect with my Google home app. I\\'m using pixel 3xl with Android version 10.You just can start and stop washing machine from mobile, no customization provided. The best useless app.It\\'s notification doesn\\'t make any sound and vibration.A little quirky seems like too much button-pushing can\\'t turn it on remotely things of that nature..After the latest updates the app works no more..This app is worthless it says my washing machine is working perfectly but my washer is not working at all..Working well, sometimes the cloud is slow..Pls create a widget for it on adroid to show the indor room temperature for aircons and a quick control on a widget. but so far its good.Keeps closing and disappeared from Google when I link it.Absolute trash I have to sign up and give away all my info for free just to get told it doesn\\'t know what my issue is with my appliance..Great!!... Was able to detect the issue with my refrigerator..Would be more useful if app could provide temperature control..Great app! Please include more devices such as LG LHB 755 HOME CINEMA please ????.Really handy being told when the washing had finished!!!.Does not work wth my lg tv .... What can i use? Any suggestions please HELP i need a remote asap.Will not use this app. Permissions required are unacceptable as has been mentioned by others. Permission for phone access and geographic location for a washing machine? The explanation given by LG for this is equally unacceptable and frankly insulting. If you really value you customers privacy, remove these requirements..So far so good. I\\'m appreciating the alerts..Love this refrig and the features!.App adjusts ALL timers ahead 1Hr each time I save making it FAR too hard to set a schedule accurately..We love knowing when our laundry is finished! Awesome feature!.Doesnt have the option of running the dual inverter ac at reduced 40% 80% and there on.Not really useful, it\\'s not bad but it seems dated and I don\\'t find much use for it..Only pre loaded settings, user can\\'t customise own settings for remote wash. Then whats\\' the use of IOT, wifi operated, only for notifacations?.Can\\'t run on rooted device. Why? Just why?.Helpful in so many ways.I was having an error code IE on my washer during the rinse cicle,,I use the smart diagnosis and it gave me the possible problems I check my water connections and there it was..... a hose was bent ..Love it. Wife not a technical wounded, But I can now tell her when washering finished. ??.Loved it!! Useful and easy. Thanks a lot LG!.Robust and user friendly. Lots of ways to do diagnosis.Works well, secure but a bit flaky.Keep saying failed to connect to server and crashes.Please update the software its getting stucked.Doesn\\'t let me reset water filter.It was very helpful becuse now the problem with the door was solved so we know that the door was broken.Worked first try!! Correctly diagnosed problem with top loader washer..The most useless app ever for washing machine. Why should they waste their time to develop such a \"technology\"? Just for downloading washing cycles? ??.Connectivity is very slow Takes too much time Loading product data.Missing multiple users option.I will like it better if it would show me the filter status.Outstanding. Keep you informed of all problems with your washing machine..Great app. Notifications are handy..Could be the best app in the world, until I can connect to Google home in Israel you\\'re getting 1 star..Ads in my notifications. Unacceptable..Wi-Fi connection requires better instructions..Great to run clothes dryer remotely.good to get new cycles and get diagnosis when to use tub clean.Has worked perfect for me, just take your time to follow the instructions.Easy to use. Has some funny features..\"Cannot run on a rooted device\" :\\\\.Can\\'t connect my washer to phone using \"tap on\" so this app is pointless..Telling me the cycle ended is fantastic to me! Why? Cause if I forget the load in the washer and go to bed for example, it will be smelly in the morning. So a little reminder to me is a major help. Thx for that LG..ridiculous app, the permissions requirement is plain stupid (the app sends texts in the background).Unable to connect to appliances !.Does not link with the google home app in ethiopia... very disappointing.Not always show me cicles I made and cicles with drying never registered..So far, it is very useful in letting me know how much time I have left for a wash cycle..Easy and notifications are nice to see!!.Loving it.... Great app... Simply awesome....Bought washing machine for like 900$ for it\\'s online features and just can\\'t use it bc my Phone is Rooted! Like, r u serious? Why would you make another version of the app for rooted devices or something like that? Just threw my money to the wind, thx LG!.Pretty useful and interesting to program my freezer!.App asked me to rate it while I was in the middle of running diagnostics on my dishwasher to stop it from beeping and it is still beeping as i write this review....Not very intuitive. To slow also..Whelp look at that. It took a year but the recent update finally let Google Home/Assistant see my Smart Dishwasher...Too bad I\\'m moving in the next month....Fridge isn\\'t working and smart thinq said everything is ok.Works great for keeping up on maintenance for our appliances.Finally got an ID. But app only useful for diagnostics and alternate cycle download.I love the option of starting my kaundry from anywhere in the house.Can t find favorites, can use shortcutes to cycles.Add feature to sync smart thinq app with Google home in India, present Google home is not responding to LG services in India..Not user friendly.... giving many options is not user friendly..... concising many options to few is intelligence of yours and user friendly to us. So update your foolishness..So easy and convenient! Luv it!.Complete waste of time.. Here\\'s a hint... Its 2019.. How about a keyboard on it that we can send over to the TV. Seen better remotes from 1980!.Poorly written instructions led to \"No functions supported for this product. Removed the app..Sr lv app Dev here. Forcing the user to give you access to their phone permissions and location is unacceptable. Worse you have the gaul to manage my wifi settings ? No. You guys are being creepy..Makes controlling my laundry during a busy day a 1000 times easier.Jumps off. Not stable..Working now, set up takes a while, its 2019, i feel like it should be be way faster. 30secs instead of 3mins....Basic app , that has all the options you need. Not complicated..Doesn\\'t do much. It would be better if I could create new washing cycles such as a 10 minute sterilise cycle.Why doesn\\'t it let me know the door got left open, like it shows on TV..Good app. I love how it alerts you..Alexa will not turn LG TV ON but will turn OFF TV.Can not run on rooted phone but I ain\\'t rooted -_-.Its awesome and the time of day hasbeen increased due to the machine.It\\'s ok when it works. I can\\'t start the washer from my phone.very useful but not friendly to use.Server connection error closes the app. Are you familiar with user experience?.It just let you change and monitoring temperature of fridge thru the internet, nothing more....Please add Wake on LAN support for TV Remote.Doesn\\'t work on rooted devices even if we block su access for this app.Can\\'t use on my other smart gadgets and appliances.Bought W/D pair 1/1/20. CR Best Buy! Plan to return machines to Lowe\\'s. App has never connected in 3 wks of trying. Phone support 1 hour 1/18/20, & AGAIN 1/26/20. Promised they\\'d call back. They did not. Spent near $2000 on Washer WT7300CW and Dryer DLE7300WE. Using app on Moto Z3 Play Android 9 over WiFi router 5\\' AWAY on 2.4GHz. Required permissions are unacceptable, see reviews. Conceded to them against better judgement. LG customer support is awful! APP is Amazon- LG Spyware. Don\\'t buy LG!.It works but I wish it could start the dryer.Great little app that works well with my LG washer.Very helpful and easy to use!.Dont ever want to connect........ what a joke.Asks for unreasonable permissions and won\\'t let you run without them. There is zero reason why my washer needs to make phone calls, see my contacts or check my location. Uninstalled. This is really sleezy, They claim it\\'s to check country... There are better less intrusive, creepy, or spyware ways of doing that. Never buying anything LG again now that I know they\\'re a sleezeball company..Why is it not working on rooted device?.Heatee kept tripping the electric couldn\\'t use this to diagnose.I just want to start the dryer remotely. I dont understand why I can\\'t turn the dryer on if it is powered off..Super and easy.Shows the error which already the decide shows. So wastage of time.App needs location data and cellular data to work..Simple to the point fixes as needed..Can\\'t run on a rooted device. Why?.This app requires location and phone permissions for no reason except for data gathering. No LG maintenance team, \"to work properly\" is not a reason. My washing machine should work without knowing where it is. No matter how smart it is. Also the registration is really annoying. I just wanted a simple spinning program. Should be no big deal, actually..Smart diagnostic option not working properly.Awesome experience provided by LG.. Thank you.This app is a blatant attempt to collect your personal info. Downloaded it to use the Smart Diagnosis feature for a defective LG dryer. Requires location and phone permission or it won\\'t work. To use the Smart Diagnosis, you need to create an LG account (requires personal info) then you have to register your product (more personal info). In the end the Smart Diagnosis told me that the dryer was operating properly! I was so relieved - I guess stalling every 30 seconds must be a feature!.It was helpful and I didn\\'t have to call my the maintenance or insurance for my fridge.Wish it sent alerts when the door is left open..Location and Phone Access are *mandatory*, but unnecessary permissions. It\\'s very shady..Please add a Dark theme to the app and the Controller notification so that it matches the Dark mode on Android 9.0 and 10 on Galaxy Note 10+ devices..Doesn\\'t work on a mesh network..Sooooo poor app Does not give washing options Hope u fix it.I installed this for my washer and dryer. There\\'s no way to see what the settings are for all the different programs I can use ahead of time. Also, the app requires crazy permissions just to let me use it. There\\'s no reason to let you track my location or make phone calls. Just let me use my dryer..Very useful and newbie friendly...Cannot diagnose fridge compressor failure.Thanks to a new settings i can easily connect my fridge thanks.Great app, update you status of your appliances.Works well. Wish it could do a bit more..Seems to work as expected, no issues so far.Very handy with real time information!.It is working, with NFC enabled washing machine.Works great does more then i really need it to do..Excellent app to make note of all your lg devices.Very Helpful app.. Making life easier..Why does the Magic link button say \"not available in current state?\".Fantastic washer and app.It works flawlesslesy for my washing machine.Very helpful app to connect your product for oprate lg product..(edited) To look up a single, complete Operation Manual, you must first give odd permissions to know what language is recommended and then requires that you make a new LG account or a Facebook/Google account. Too much unneeded hurdles to view a single complete Operation Manual. Additionally, why not try to get the location permission when you first try to connect to the device? As now, the manual is locked being a permission \"paywall\" due to only being on the app..Doesn\\'t work with Alexa..The app won\\'t open anymore since 3 updates ago..easy to use and notifications is real time.Alexa can\\'t find the device. Rubbish.Was great until it got deleted from my phone without my help. Very strange, but it can be quite useful, like when on vacation, to alter settings and check functionality. Or to pop it into ice plus mode while out at the store on July 4th..Superb app to use with smart device at home.First time used...super and easy i must say..lets see its durability....The old app worked fine on my phone, but now it doesn\\'t work at all, and I need it to download a dryer only setting. It keeps closing randomly, and I can\\'t do anything with the washer when it\\'s selected in the app. This is very annoying since I\\'ve got a load of wet clothing waiting to be dried..Easy set up. Works great..Once setup it\\'s great. Will use it all the time now..Excellent with LG air conditioner.....Had to test a few times but effective.Account set up not user friendly.Make more advance options , go innovative in App building.The smart diagnosis function is very helpful.App is working perfectly.. no complaints.I want the ability to order filters directly from the app.Quite useful, i wish lg can enable google home for malaysia user.Old app is beter bcoz old app energy monitoring properly.I can\\'t connect LG Smart ThinQ with the Google Home App in Greece ??.Love my new washer. Uses less water and tells me when it\\'s done. Love it.Excellent app and product.Dissatisfied with the integration with Alexa.It is simple to use.Good simple easy use.Says my device is rooted yet I have not rooted my device.User friendly and efficient.Pls buy LG front load machine..and use it thru app...FIX THE SCHEDULING FEATURE. The last update broke the schedule feature, making it impossible to edit or add a new schedule for my AC. All attempts give an error message and take you back to the home screen. I had no problems with connectivity or the app prior to the update. Please fix this or make it possible to revert back to the previous version of the app..Excellent fridge easy to use.App wants too many permissions. Access to make phone calls! Despite trying two android devices and a dedicated wifi access point set to WPA security, simple SSID and simple 8 character password; the washing machine could not connect to WiFi. Smart diagnostics worked via Bluetooth..log in, add tv: no problem. link with Google Assistant, doesn\\'t work. log out, log in, tv is no longer there. not saving my TV to my account, so it doesn\\'t show up in Assistant or on other devices, and is deleted when i log out. what is the point of even having an account??? actually TV controls work ok. its like the remote. wish I could see the TV menus on my phone, instead of using the touchscreen as a trackpad. excellent in-notification controls..It\\'s a good app just wish I had more control over the washing machine..App started using my push notifications for advertising, no setting to opt out. No LG, I do not want to auto buy detergent..want to turn dryer elements off and can\\'t.You click on the app then wait ~10 seconds for it to connect to our 3 devices. Only then can tell one of then to turn on. Not sure what the deal but I seem to have to hover a bit to activate the on/off button. The remote has different settings, so if you both remote and phone then you the user has to manually sync them. Frequent \"upgrades\" means you have to login in again, and data loss as in my preferences for celcius. Weather gadget takes 40% of screen and only shows Fahrenheit. Ugh..I bought a fridge freezer with wifi so I could use the app to see the temperatures inside the fridge and freezer compartments. The wifi version cost about 100 Euro more. Nothing to complicated there, until you find out the only temperatures you see on the app (or the fridge door for that matter) are what LG call \\'target temperatures\\', you can adjust the \\'target temperatures\\' but you have no idea if the fridge freezer has achieved them, at no point does the fridge door or app display the current internal temperatures The fridge freezer itself is great but what is the point of the app? Surely the most fundamental information you want from a wifi enabled fridge freezer is the inside temperatures, I understand that if I leave the door open it will send me an alert but come on is that it, I would not leave the door open anyway and unless the cat develops ninja skills and starts raiding the fridge overnight it is not going to happen. As a remote interface with my fridge this app is about as much use as a chocolate tea pot. Back to the shelf thermometer..So easy! Love it!!.Good functionality, terrible design.Pretty smart app & product.Update bricked my fridge - I had my wifi enabled fridge connected to the app, but once the app was updated, I could no longer control my fridge from the app. I have been trying for HOURS to get the fridge to connect - to no avail. Nothing ever happens..Basic \\'smart home\\' functionality, serviceable app, Google Assistant/Home connectivity. Despite the promise of glossy commercials for the smart home, the state of LG smart appliances (I have three of them) is basic as of summer 2019. This app is needed to connect the LG appliance to your home Wi-Fi, but is sparse, icons and terms don\\'t line up well with those on the appliance itself. The best part might be Google Assistant/Home connectivity, which worked well for me. Three stars from me..I\\'m guessing this app replaced the LG Smart Laundry&DW app and is not compatible with my 4 year old LG washer and dryer. Only thing the app will let me do is downlaod a cycle, and even then they only option is small load. I wanted to be able to check the stats of my laundry, since our laundry room is now in the basement. The app wasn\\'t needed at our old house, as the laundry room was on the first floor and we could hear when the load was finished. Not good, LG..Utterly useless.  Worse than the front panel controls, with fewer options.  Won\\'t even allow timed dry, and has to be re-enabled on the dryer\\'s control panel every time you use it.  Most of the downloadable programs are the opposite of what I want, and LG forbids you to create your own.  RATIONALE/USE CASE:  Because high heat is so damaging to clothing, and because dryers (especially our LG dryer) are so bad at sensing humidity, I\\'ve found the _only_ way to get properly dry clothes without damage or wrinkles is to run _several_ timed dry sessions with rest periods in between.  First low or medium, then a rest to allow moisture to redistribute, then a low immediately followed by air dry to cool and avoid wrinkles.  It works great manually, and an app _should_ be great for doing this with fewer trips to the laundry room, but LG\\'s app forbids this usage..Nice features and good information..Good app. LG is the best.Experience is pretty good but i would still advice feew add-ins. It would be nice to see energy consumed in kWh not just bars without value. (at least on dryers). Also would be good if notification (remote) would be changing into dark theme with rest of android . For the washing machine would be nice to be able to customize programs like you can on LCD Screen of washer itself (change RPM, and temperature) ..The problem with this app is the time it takes to establish a connection with our AC units. It\\'s quicker to get up and grab the normal control and switch it on. Our LAN and WiFi network uses corporate equipment and all our other devices and Smart system works perfectly. LG you need to sort this performance lag out as there is no point using the app.Really easy and helpful.i have never had this app correctly control the AC. it is by far the worst thing about the unit. The schedule randomly changes upon setting. Very often the unit will completely disconnect and be uncontrollable from app. Previous smart wifi air conditioning controller from Flair never had any issues like this. Wish my old unit still worked i would go back to it. 10/10 would NOT buy an LG again..This does the basics for my American style fridge freezer, but it could do so much more and with a better UX. For example, it should register my warranty, show exact model, include a searchable manual, have a vacation mode, and be able to remote control outside the network. Nice stats on what\\'s going on inside would get you a 5 star: actual inside and outside temp graph, uptime (since last powered on) and active life span (total minutes receiving power since manufacture) would be cool..Connected it to the dryer.. Complete waste of time. Im sure it does other cool stuff but the dryer connectivity is nothing short of pointless. Says you can \\'download cycles\\', but there\\'s only one listed (\\'really dry\\', or something dumb like that). Doesn\\'t give u alerts or allow you to control anything remotely (on my dryer model anyway)..I rarely write reviews, but this is stupid. What is the point of the app and connecting it to your voice assistant if you have turn on a device, ex. washer, manually and enable remote start. This defeats the entire purpose of the products being smart appliances. I should be able to control the appliance whether it\\'s on or off, but the fact I have to physically turn it on and enable remote start is counterproductive. Either allow users to properly control the appliance remotely or don\\'t bother..Great app. Highly helpful..Terrible, apps forcibly turns on the Wi-Fi when starting it, making it impossible to download cycles due to the firewall. Can\\'t use 4G to download them. Tried contacting support but they don\\'t care. Also forces location sharing for weather info?.Very good app for smart products connect.Product has already been added in another country The app as the LG refrigerator that I acquired (GM84SXD, supposedly top of the line) is absolutely junk... The app cannot be synchronized with the equipment because it says it\\'s already been registered in another country and there are no qualified technicians that can help. With regard to the fridge, After only 1 year the compressor makes horrible noises (which the technician say is normal), the freezer and ice makers needs to be replaced....Won\\'t install on my galaxy tab 6a running 8.1. Tried it on my older s4, installed but won\\'t run because my phone is rooted. What a waste of time. On top of this my new 2019 LG tv won\\'t connect to my Google home. Very poor LG..this app sucks. the only programmability i have for my mini splits is when to turn them on or off. i cant schedule different temperatures/modes at different times like a regular wifi thermostat is capable of, whichs make these super difficult to use. it should be simple to implement. lg needs to update the app to add that functionality..Depending on what phone you have the software may work until you wait for a software update.It is very difficult to use.the app most of the time isn\\'t quite sure if my tv is on or off, the lag is incredible,,  as for connectivity to google, it must be a joke, never managed to get the server to respond,,   If Lg is serious about voice control,,, skip the lg step and make an app to respond to google directly,,  great tv ,, lousy app.This app seems too basic for what it can really provide. I have an LG smart tv and this app only functions like the tv remote when using the app. I\\'m better off just using the remote. Just wish it had more to offer. Otherwise, it works as intended which is why it gets an average rating from me..I have latest version of washing machine. Can\\'t set time of wash, Can\\'t set times of rinse, Can\\'t set (low,medium,high) of spin. Waste of time in washing machine, needs to be update this app please...It\\'s helpful, for sure..Works to control AC, but setting a schedule is nearly impossible. when adding a schedule entry from 8:30-11, it saves it as 9:30-12. Add a second entry, and the original moves forward a second hour (now 10:30-1). Additionally, days change in the schedules when you click save. Please fix your app. Additionally, instructions for connecting AC to web are different in app vs owners manual. You do not hold Mode+Fan on the LP1419IVSM, you should only hold fan to enable wifi..Really usefull app, can monitor, connect and controll both of my airconditioning units the way i want to. One thing i hate though, it keeps putting on my Bluetooth. Why the hell can i not choose to disable that, why is that mandatory and not an option ???? I\\'m not even at home when using the app.So overall satisfied with it..Horrible app. Needs alot of work company like lg should remove till fixed. Can not add aircon. Get all way pass connection then register and drops out app. Says all time can not connect server. Very poor..This app is useless. Every 30 days it stops connecting to my a/c and the only way to fix it is to delete everything and re-install. Never had any problems with the old a/c app.Errors when registering air conditioner. Previously worked and inexplicably stopped working one day, unable to get it to connect. Just states \"registration failed\" and has for a couple of months now without a fix. Useless for controlling the smart devices it\\'s supposed to be used with..08.17.19 The Schedule setting for A/C\\'s is that being worked on, it has not worked since the updated last month it was working fine.  **PLEASE fix it or make the prior version of the app available**  I\\'ve done complete uninstalls, cleared data & cache with no discernible changes. If this is fixed I will update this review Also, on the \\'Energy Monitoring\\' 902 days vs the ~month ive had it?  So confusing..Lousy!!!! No wifi on my front load washer. Tag On NFC feature doesn\\'t work with iOS nor does it work with my LG Nexus 5 Android phone with NFC enabled. Only could add washer with smart diagnostics. Even then could NOT add any custom wash programs. Dumb move LG - add what appears to be a cool features to your appliances but they DON\\'T WORK!!!.Struggled about 1 hours to connect a smart fridge, it went to step 3 only once where you can tell the fridge which wifi network to connect, but then the few sec setup mode delayed out. The whole process is a garbage. Update: the issue was phone related, my Huawei P20 didnt worked, was able to connect with a Galaxy S6..I downloaded this app because i want to check my washer-dryer. When i tried the diagnosis part, apparently in one of the steps, i need to press and hold a button, after i did that nothing happened. So yeah, i didn\\'t know if it\\'s only mine that didn\\'t work. My washer-dryer have the diagnosis thing in it..Excellent app to yrack working of products.Everything works great, I love it.A bit of lag in starting and updating. Installed many of the AC units and it\\'s the same at every customer. App functions are good just a bit to slow in responding compared to products like Hive app..The app notification lacks specific info for ordering replacement water & air filters ...I should be able to take my phone to HD or Lowes and order the correct filters and not have dig out my frig manual..Doesnt link well to alexa.Please include all the functions that are present in remote controller of AC in the app. The app is missing the energy control function, sleep function, light off function. Also the app is slow in connecting to the air conditioner, we need to wait for 10-15 seconds..Great app and appliance experience.Useful app to check ur product problems.An ok app... Diagnosis of problems is nice, but sure would be nice if that could just be obtained through WiFi. Alexa integration is cool.Not completely functional after recent update. I am unable to add multiple schedules. I have a schedule set so the unit will turn on at 6:00 p.m. every night, with the new app update I am unable to set it on sleep mode right before I go to bed. This is very frustrating, it worked before the last update ??.As of 2019-07-28, after the latest update, when trying to edit schedules for the window unit air conditioners, the schedule entries in the app cannot be edited w/o crashing out to the main screen. It worked before the update, now it doesn\\'t. Others are having the same issue..LG this is pretty sad on your part... Just brought a Smart TV yesterday. 8/3/2019 and this App will ONLY turn it OFF. You mean to tell in \"2019\" your App can\\'t even turn the a Smary TV ON... Are you KIDDING ME???? It\\'s a ON and OFF function. Let\\'s get real people. Hire someone who can build a App. As much money we pay for your Appliances..The only thing it\\'s good for it letting you know when your laundry is done. It doesnt work if the machines are off. If they were going to go as far as putting wifi in these things they should have at least built in a scheduling function and a function to allow you to remotely turn on the appliances..I use my phone\\'s mobile hotspot for wifi. Unfortunately this app will not work without a standalone wifi access point. Poor planning on LG\\'s behalf. And this app won\\'t even show up in the play store on my tablet. Booo! Also requires location information to work. Stay out of my private life, LG!.What a wonderful smart washing machine, love it!.App keeps logging me out.This app is horrible. App needs permission for location and for making calls. Why? I do not know. If you refuse to allow it, it says goodbye and closes itself. So without allowing potentially dangerous permissions for your privacy you will not be able even open it. How can I try fancy features of my washing machine without telling you where I am or without allowing you to call anybody you want?And I regret buying LG washing machine. Part of the features are in this app and you cannot use them..i gave a 5 star before. but today i deleted my 5 and i will give a 1 star. why? because the app since today FORCING me to log in. you can log in with facebook or google accounts as well. of course the 2 most notoriouse abuser of user data. this app is to controll my devices so why the hell am i supposed to LOG IN???. sorry LG but this is disgusting to sell your clients!!!!.Saved me the cost of calling a, plumber, to diagnose and troubleshoot a clogged washer drain line. We were able to identify the issue via the app and do the work ourselves..Why it\\'s only work with Chrome now? After the last update the app says Update your browser and transfer my to Play Market to download Chrome. I hate Chrome..the Download option is almost useless. it should allow you to completely customize a cycle. App fails to find Washer about 10% of the time. Integration will Google Home/Assistsnt is confined to asking the assistant what the Washer is doing. One would think you vou could get notifed when the Washer is done, but no.my 2 year old fridge is not working. i am using the self diagnostic feature. it doesn\\'t work via wifi and the audible diagnostic isnt working either. i dont know if it\\'s the app or fridge but rhis stinks. barely 2 years old (purchased 9/22/17) and over $3k and it\\'s dead. HELP!!!!.It\\'s a very useful app, but I wish LG as deploying technician who has been knowledge about Smart ThinQ. My Technician haven\\'t enough knowledge about Smart ThinQ and he asks his senior, he is also not advised clearly, finally my son studied in Google about Smart ThinQ and he explained everything about it and successfully using it. really nice App.Clunky and unintuitive app..Why does this app *really* need permissions to access your location, messages, and call data? Their explanation is lacking. I\\'m willing to bet you all are pimping us out and selling our data, aren\\'t you. Anyways, this app misses a ton of good opportunities to be useful anyway..Tuch penal options note opret your mobail.Still terrible after the server update.....what a waste.Mines excessive amounts of personal data. I shouldn\\'t need to hand over Facebook, Amazon, telephone no., and DOB info just to adjust the temp on an air conditioner..Good at first experience..Useful and helpful.This app is blimin garbage, always has issues connecting and barely works with our air-conditioner (its brand new). This is one of those apps you can tell the company didnt spend that long developing and always has issues. Is that hard to make an app that can turn my aircon on and off??.I purchased a new LG Refigerator a month ago. After several attempts, I was able to connect it to my cellphone. last week purcased a new LG Dishwasher; after numerous attemps still cannot connect it. I sent emails to LG & SmartThinQ & no responses. Diswasher works great but not the wifi program. Very disappointed!.Works well, once you figure out HOW to get it working. The washer\\'s manual wasn\\'t helpful, as it expected you to know how to GET to the settings and all. I had to call LG\\'s tech dept. to help explain how to register the device..Well before update all was working fine. after update aircon keeps disconnection from wifi scheduler keeps runing crazy... what can i say typical Korean fix style it to make it worst LG and other korean manufactures the same story on and on QA does not exist to support customer who bought korean product. make change without checking if ot works.... Fix lagging SmarthinQ im running on Samsung S8.Love my LQ Washer & Dryer and this app !! ???.permission requirements are a non starter. eg. There is zero reason for them to collect via privacy policy my phone IMEI and MAC address, you don\\'t need location tracking back to LG, outside of the application, etc. Beyond the bare permission requirements which are over the top, the privacy policy is clearly abusive towards user privacy..for me the main reason I bought this AC is to have the weekly scheduling in the app which i used for the first week it worked but all of a sudden it doesn\\'t allow me more than one schedule weekly not sure what happened, when I try to add another weekly schedule it comes up as please try again at normal operation.does not work at all, shoud be zero stars, app is a joke.Countless times i had put a load of washing on, gone away and done something else, come back and the load had faulted. I downloaded the app and connected to the washing machine, did a diagnostic run on it, it told me the faults and how to fix them. I fixed them and away it went, no problems since.Schedule changes from what you set it to. Every time you save a schedule, the time you have set changes, one hour is added to the start and end time. Very odd. It also seems to change by itself over time. Completely useless..This app could not be connected to Google home and its advertising everywhere. I spent few hours trying to solve the problem without result. Lot of same issues reported online but without solutions. Support from LG is worst I expired ever..LG is consumer hostile. Be aware of the following before purchasing an LG product. FULL LOCATION PERMISSIONS ARE REQUIRED TO RUN THIS APP. This means that you will have to consent to LG\\'s tracking of your every move just so you can be notified your washer\\'s done. This is an abusive tactic and there is no legitimate reason LG should require this. PUSH ADS ARE FORCED AND POP UP ON YOUR NOTIFICATION BAR.. Out at a nice dinner? Prepare to be interrupted as you toast your friend. Amazon has laundry detergent on sale! These push ads cannot be disabled without disabling the only useful features this app has. Neither of these consumer hostile policies is necessary. The smart app on for my GE appliances neither tracks me nor pushes ads. LG, if you\\'re reading this: I just bought two new big screen TVs. These would have absolutely been LG TVs if it weren\\'t for this app and your policies. Now there won\\'t be another LG product purchased for my home. ________________________________________________________________ LG has responded to this review with a SHAMELESS, BLATANT LIE. Location permissions ARE NOT required to search for WiFi networks and they know it. I have other appliance apps on my phone that do not need location permissions and have found and connected to my WiFi network without a problem..Good and smart to use with washer.Sometimes doesn\\'t work..Enable IFTTT or smart home like Athom Homey ideally.Useful with the smart diagnostic system.Good and easy to use.Is there any way to run this app on rooted device\\'s? LG I love your products but this restriction is...This App caused Firefox to be deleted, and filled up my SD card with LG images. Uninstalling the App did not remove the images, which I had to delete manually..Horrible UI and poor cycle choice.Awesome to know when wash is done on time..Very nice app helped me so much.Great on the spot information.this app sucka since the last update. first would not connect to my AC, now that ive finally reset everything and got it reconnected, it takes forever to load and always crashes. useless now. better off keeping the remote and a flashlight nearby.Awesome app. Works like it supposed too..The finished cycle alerts are very helpful.Not working on rooted phones. It\\'s a program to check and downoad programs for a washing machine, not a banking app. Come on!.works pretty good. wish it would show humidity in the room as well. The app starts fairly slow. Would love to have the sleep option on the app too, not just on the unit..new version is cleaner but Energy Management for wall mounted AC is full of bugs.. it doesn\\'t show the current consumption correctly, and charts are confusing! what\\'s wrong with numbers and tables? also WHERE IS COMFORT MODE?.Useless app for remote appliance control. Takes forever to connect, randomly drops connection. As a convenience app this is terrrrrrible..reminds me to change the laundry, that\\'s pretty much all. I was under the impression I could change settings or restart a load from the app but it disconnects as soon as a cycle finishes..Worst app not able to detect problem.After multiple attempts to login to the app, I discovered you have to disconnect from your Wi-Fi to login successfully via mobile data to bypass the network error. Unfortunately, I\\'m constantly having to login whenever I access the app, which means I have to disconnect from the Wi-Fi to login successfully. The push notifications, however, seem to work without being logged in, so the app is a 3-star for me since it seems to be working OK..I purchased an LG washer and dryer with WiFi capabilities. This app is extremely slow and basically only notifies you when the washer and dryer are done (or tells you how much time is left). There is a way to upload custom cycles to your appliance, but it is not really useful. What\\'s worse is that the app requires A LOT of permissions to be enabled that it doesn\\'t need for any legitimate purpose other than to collect information about me. Why does this app need access to my location at all times? LG doesn\\'t need to know when I am home or when I am out somewhere else just to see the status of my laundry. If I turn the location permission off, the app stops working. In addition, LG seems to have frequent updates to the terms of service that you must agree to or the app will not work. Who wants to frequently read legalese to see if you are being forced to give up more rights? I hope LG fixes these problems soon..Initial connection with the a/c was very straining..App is a great concept but it won\\'t let me download any cycles to my washing machine. Just tells me it has failed to download cycle to machine every time. It also doesn\\'t have any data on energy monitoring. Just says no recent history. Very disappointing. I\\'ve uninstalled app and reinstalled several times. Cleared the cache but it still won\\'t work. Any advice would be appreciated..Worked for the first couple of days, then out of nowhere ceased functioning. I can still turn on my my LG LP1417wsrsm from the app, but I can no longer adjust any settings. It will not allow me to see the current set temperature, adjust it, fan speed, anything. Its just blank. I was directed to LG support forums, had someone ask me for my model # and never posted anything else. Not sure what else to do at this point..App needs a bit of work. Instruction wording doesn\\'t match up to what\\'s actually on the appliance screen. Then this is just a big annoyance, why can my wife not use it at home on a tablet? This is the convenience people seek. Why will it only work with devices with a SIM card? It\\'s in the home connected to the same WiFi but somehow an Appliance needs a device with Mobile capabilities? Not sure I understand the logic there. No, she does not have an Android or IOS, but the tablet is right there..pretty useless. Must turn on machine to use the phone app, and it is way more complicated to use than the control panel. When the cycle completes and the machine turns off, you must go turn on the machine to get a report! Turning on \"remote start\" from the machine\\'s control panel only works if you go turn on the machine. I\\'ll give them credit, no hacker will ever breach their security and turn on the machine maliciously..I appreciate the notifications that the washer and dryer are done since they are in the basement. The app is a little buggy with connecting to the appliances at times..the Schedule feature is something to be desired. its very confusing! what is 15hr turn on? an I scheduling specific hours after I turn the unit off or is this 15:00 hours aka 3:00PM Really would be nice if you could use IFTTT service to open up options for a Smarter Air conditioning service..Very high and good app.I have 2 air conditioners. The app worked great for a year, now it see\\'s both air conditioners, but not the data/settings within. Removing and re-adding didn\\'t help.  Update: Thanks for your response LG. The reinstall didn\\'t help initially, but a few days later the data within the air conditioners started showing up. Now I have access to all the settings, except temperature. I\\'ll reach out to tech support, and update accordingly..Privacy and terms have just changed for the worst. LG wants to share personal data with third party \"service providers\". The problem is the app does not let you see what personal data they have. Nowhere in the app can I do that nor is it clear where and how I can do that. I would like to know what personal data LG has collected, I want it deleted and I\\'ll be terminating my account/deleting this app!!.WOW! What a stupid App!! Why so many PERMISSIONS?? Why can\\'t I use it without location and phone permissions?? Can\\'t use it without login!! Why does it need my Date Of BIRTH?? And the app name is \"SMART\", which is only smart thing about it!! LG = Life Gone!!.This app used to work but now it claims that I\\'m rooted and it won\\'t anymore.  Doesn\\'t matter much anyway, the app sucks.  It lacks content and functionality.  Just because you can create an app doesn\\'t mean you should.I received my new LG refrigerator today, installed the app and followed the easy Wi-Fi setup instructions without any issues.  I\\'m new to the app, so this is not a review, but more of a feature request.  The food expiration feature is a great add, however, I believe the current design is inefficient for managing food items.   The current process: 1. Open Manage Food 2. Click Add Food button 3. Locate a food item by category or search for. If you don\\'t find an item you can create a new user item.  4. Add item to your refrigerator or freezer area 5. Navigate back to the Manage Food page  6. Locate the added item within my items 7. Open the item and add the expiration date.   Whew!! That\\'s a lot of work to add one item and the expiration date.  I recommend you add barcode scanning functionality and the following process: 1. Open Manage Food 2. Click Add Food by Barcode (new feature) 3. View item details, select refrigerator or freezer area and set expiration date from this page.   Done! This would be a much better user experience.  I will begin using the app daily, I\\'ll update by rating if appropriate.  Thanks for your time and consideration!.Love it, works well with everything.LOVE IT, everyday usage.This app has a very limited options (ductless AC units), I think it was created at leat 10 years ago, and never been improved after that, not user friendly at all. I\\'ll bet, all customers will be greatful to see advance time schedules with options for temperatures and air flows, and have an option for night mode, shut off the annoying beeping. Description of the modes (home, away, sleep, etc.) and ability to customize it as needed. As for now it is very poor application for such company as LG, very disappointed..The app may be ok. However the Wi-Fi will NOT connect to a net work name that has a special character in it. My net work has a special character. I have connected numerous other TV\\'s, home security, cameras. thermostats etc. to the network. LG is the only appliance brand that will not connect, thus making the app and LG smart appliances useless to me. It is unbelievable to me that a world wide corporation product cannot connect to a wi-fi network with a special character in the name..Connection issues gallore. use it for my lg ductless heat pumps. nearly every time I go to use the remote interface, one or both systems have a connection error. I have to go home, disconnect, then reconnect the malfunctioning wifi connector. I don\\'t have connection problems for any of my other devices, including other brands of wifi thermostats in my house. there are clearly issues with these lg controls. fyi, I am an HVAC contractor with many years of experience. I sell and install lg systems..A/C WiFi has a serious flaw. Registration ok, works for 12-24 hrs, then says \"Off\". You cannot turn it back on remotely because \"It is either Off or not connected to the network\". This is the MAIN thing. It MUST work. Connection - strong and healthy, no issues there. Please fix this, it is truly disappointing..Just like many other reviews in here, I\\'m very disappointed. I have a LG mini split mutizone AC system with 3 wall mount units. Each unit needs to be registered. Again as others have noted it needs a 2.4 wifi router and apparently a 5khz will not work, seems stupid if you ask me. Either way my router will run both. So I had 2 units registered and running. The third one I could not get registered with the app. Tried numerous times many different ways. I also noted like others have stated that if the units are off and I open the app I can\\'t turn on the units with this app. It will state next to the image the product unit is off or it is not connected to the Internet (which it is because I just connected it). So far I have emailed LG, no response..App has a lot of room for improvement. For some reason it needs my location on before it will connect to the wifi... and call status?...WHAT FOR? Too many permissions! I eventually got it to connect to my $3000 fridge, but once the fridge got the wifi data for my network, it switched over and changed its name to the generic wifi driver name, QCA4002, and now the app can\\'t find it and prompts me to restart the painful process all over again. Waste of time!.Wasted opportunity. Why does my fridge have WiFi and alert me itself when the door has been left open but this app doesn\\'t? it would\\'ve been the single most useful feature to have that alert whilst I\\'m in another room or out, but all I can do is set the temperature remotely. How often is that ever going to be useful?! Please make this improvement.push notifications no longer working after last update. i had washing machine working fine with alerts before. i just also a new dishwasher. i still dont get any alerts. no problem with LG tv controller via app.Love this washer and dryer! Would buy it again! CONS: The prest settings dont allow you to delay the wash. If you have the lid open on the washer and hit start by mistake the washer throws an error. The only way to clear is by shutting it off and starting again. PROS: Washes clothes quickly. Really love and use the delay start option. Happy it pops up on Friday hone to remind you to start it. Love that you can track the time on each units to see how much is left..App crashed when opening.Doesnt work. It request location and phone permissions and then it just hangs( does nothing, but not crash.) Like it\\'s waiting for something to happen. My guess is that it is waiting for a response from its \\'mothership\\' because i\\'m not letting it go online. I\\'m keeping it behind a firewall. If the developers were to implement an offline mode soon, i would increase the rating..update of android and smartThinQ app couldn\\'t connect to AC unit said disconnected . wifi light on. (was working). did setup again stayed at 80% failed. Removed app and reinstalled reconnected fixed problem..It took a bit to sync with the dryer. But it works great now..Using it to control a 5 zone mini-split. Works ok. App lacks fuctionality. Time zone stuck in Eastern ... Can\\'t seem to change it to Pacific ... Oddly tho - only an hour ahead. Connects to the AC unit quickly and easily. Controls them OK. App is disappointing. No ability to schedule anything other than on/off. Seems like a first draft. Needs work..This app is great for notifications and downloading new appliance settings, but aside from that, it does nothing else. There NEEDS to be more functionality. I would adopt more LG appliances and products if i had more remote control features. I cant even start my dishwasher from the app? Or change the cycles via the app? Why? I will update my review as soon as these key features are implemented..The washing machine can\\'t be turned on remotely. The cycles can\\'t be customized. I can\\'t stop the machine and change the cycle if it was not started remotely. Too many restrictions. I can\\'t even change the language. But the app tells me the weather. I don\\'t need the weather, I need the app to make my life easier. The only thing that works fine is the notification that the machine finished washing..Utterly useless. This app actually has to contact the LG server every time you press a button. My AC (6 feet away) has to contact a server 6000 miles away. Spends so long making a connection (little circle spinning around)  it quicker to go get the standard remote out of the bedroom cupboard and put in new batteries. Truly, dreadfully awful. Feels like the IT trainee knocked it up over lunch..Is only good for monitoring when the cycles are gonna be over. The \"download cycles\" feature literally never works and frequently says \"unable to use because the network is lost or your product is off\" neither of which is the case. My wifi can effortly stream 4k to my TV\\'s yet, my washer and dryer has an issue downloading cycles from the internet? Come on. Realistically that\\'s like a few KB of data. Sort it out, LG..I think it\\'s absurd that I can\\'t program my own custom cycles.. temp is my biggest issue. I hate that I can\\'t change the temp of the programming. Also after I choose my favorites, when I click on the icon in the favorites \"bar\" it takes me to a blank page instead of letting me download it to the tag. ANNOYING!!!.LG ThinQ doesn\\'t find my TV even though the LG TV Plus app works perfectly fine. My TV says it\\'s registered, I got an email from LG saying \"Thank you for registering your TV\", but the ThinQ app just says \"NO PRODUCTS REGISTERED\".  And the diagnostics tool just takes me to a blank white screen.  So I have no Google assistant functionality at all, and LG\\'s online tech support chat is unable to do anything for me, and after 2 hours they eventually just ignored me and let the chat time out.   So my \"smart tv\" is completely \"dumb\".  And the worst part is that as I look through these reviews I can see many others with exactly the same problem as me dating all the way back to late last year.....so...I\\'m taking it that LG is fully aware of the problem but has no idea how to fix it.   It might have been nice if they could have just told me that fact and saved me two hours worth of pointless ill-quipped tech support efforts.   If you\\'re thinking of buying an LG TV because you\\'re reading \"Works with Google Assistant\" then don\\'t, because it doesn\\'t..So far it has done everything I want it to do. It\\'s nice being able to turn on the AC from work, then by the time I get home it\\'s nice and cool. I would have given this app 5 stars. But every time I use the app, the app turns on my bluetooth. KILLED my battery because I didn\\'t notice this right away. Why do you need my bluetooth on when I am away makes no sense. There should be a way to turn this off. But there is not. Should fix this!.In principle I really liked the idea of a phone app to control my LG appliances. However, it doesn\\'t really control them remotely. The app appears to have been designed by a liability lawyer working group instead of home chefs. All the nanny oversight limitations require you to go over to the oven and do things. So much for * remote * control. E.g., once a timer expires, you have to go over to the oven before you can reset the timer for a few more minutes of baking. Argh! Focus on functionality!.Horribly slow app that constantly wants to download product information until it finally fails. Takes forever to find the air conditioner just one mind you. While my WeMo app units are found with virtually no discernible lag.Works like a charm. Saved me from diagnostic nightmare.Works with my Refrigerator.Works well for my purposes (heat pump). Note that many apps will not always function properly via a wi-fi connection. Once you have configured your LG device to connect to your local network, turn off wi-fi on your smartphone and reconnect (to your LG account) via the cell network (to check for downloads, etc.). (Version 2.3.1401working fine via wi-fi / cell)..Works Great for me! I Love that when I\\'m upstairs I don\\'t have to keep going up and down the stairs to check if the Washer or Dryer is Done! Saves me a lot of time too cause you know when your clothes are Done so you can keep up with it and get it done quicker! Great app, there was some issues in the Beginning but with a Few Updates they have Done, it\\'s Been Working Great! Definitely a Plus for Me!.Using on a Mini Split. Works fine. I can control the heat while away. One Zone seems to be in a different time zone, might have to reset the time with the remote??? Wish it had an option when on a schedule to work like smart thermostat and cut back the heat not the same temp it was the last time it was turned off..Couldn\\'t login to my LG account, had use different account therefore sharing lots of private personal information. Email to support was unanswered. NFC pairing with my dryer was very finicky and took several tries to accomplish. After all that I\\'m told that my dryer doesn\\'t support WiFi even though it\\'s supposed to, and consequently I couldn\\'t get message when a dryer load was done. That\\'s all I wanted and it took way too much work to figure that out.  In response to your question my Dryer is (from the receipt) a \"DLE3170W 7.4CF FL ELEC DRYER ULTRA CAP\"..Useless piece of s*** :( I selected LG washing machine, mainly because the smart function, but the app is painfully slow and functionless. Waiting 20+ seconds just to see the remaining time is absolutely useless. I can download fancy named (but technically similar) programs to the machine, but can\\'t edit any own. Can\\'t connect the notification to any third party system (like Google or Alexa). Need a lot of development!.Bought a new c8 tv, what\\'s the point of it saying it\\'s connected/registered on the tv, when the tv does not display itself in either google home/assistant or smart thinq app. This was the first time I went for LG, and if this ain\\'t resolved, it\\'s also the last. Thanks for letting my waste more than 4k on a device that is so ancient that it is not functional with the future of smart homes.  Hence I mentioned that it concludes with the TV displaying that the TV is registered to google, however what help is there in it saying that when it does not appear in Google home/ assistant for me to properly control?  I have light switches that I registered to google that appears in my list of devices allowing me to make them apart of different locations. While with this it just tells me it is, and there\\'s nothing to help me improve my home automation to allocate the tv to some sort of location.  To conclude, how is it that a 30 dollar device is more compatible with google(better smart device) than your $4k+ tv, TRAGIC..Impossible to connect the television with the application. I\\'ve waste a lot of time by reading the guides on the lg website and even so I have not been able to find the solution. All the forums that I\\'ve consulted the people there also find the same problem and no solution. Although I had read that it was possible to do so from Spain, there is a message saying that there is no option to do so from my country..UPDATED 12152018: LG finally fixed the notifications to work with your default Android notification scheme. No more annoying pop-ups on the lock screen and pop-ups in general if you don\\'t use them like me. Can\\'t complain about the permissions, because if your app needs the WiFi App such as this to grant appliance access to WiFi, that is GOOGLE\\'S REQUIREMENT AND IT\\'S STUPID! Again, won\\'t hold LG responsible for this. Haven\\'t come up with a use case for the app other than end of cycle notifications for my washer and dryer. I know you can program or start cycles from the app, but still haven\\'t experienced a time that I would want to do it..Seems pointless. Huge permission request. Went through and tried register dryer. It worked then when it goes back to main page it decides it\\'s not registered after all. Hit the home button and it seems to be \"profiles\" which is not really relevant for a dryer. Since can\\'t see anything useful (like a schedule or electricity usage) I\\'m uninstalling.Used To Be Good, The Update Sucks! With the update, my LG AC won\\'t be able to connect with the WiFi I have at home. The WiFi in the Led display won\\'t blink and won\\'t appear. Now, I\\'m just using the remote. Bummer. Now, how can I set the AC ON when I\\'m on my way home? LG, please fix this. I love to use the app but now I\\'m only using the remote. The router I have is near the AC as well. Please fix this ASAP.Requires the app to be able to control your Wi-Fi... Which made it almost impossible to check any other app. Plus, I still can\\'t connect to my new dishwasher. Fail..Why is it everytime there is an update i have to re register my product. Very very poor. And now we have to have an account to see temp of fridge and feezer. Not bothering as it is not worth the effort. Ill get another brand next time..Downloaded app tried tried sign in with my LG account info and it doesn\\'t recognize it. So I guess that makes this app useless to me..Very good told me everything about my fridge.So, I was using this to operate my Smart ThinQ AC for a couple of days and monitor the energy usage. But after the recent maintenance break on the app, the AC just isn\\'t showing the WiFi LED. I purchased the damn AC thinking that it\\'ll be better to handle from anywhere!! But now that feature isn\\'t even working! I could have bought any other AC if I didn\\'t want to have that feature!.I used to be able to control my ducted system via this app. Then you took the functionality away. Ie. The menu does not exist for ducked on iOS or Android. However I had a scheduled timing setup on the app and the aircon system still thinks the app is there. Now I have not air turn on at 5am daily with no way of turning it off. So disappointed. Please put the ducked aircon back on. This is a major reason I bought the system in the first place..Product should always be connected to wifi source once set, not everytime you turn it on you would need to set it. Also, I should be able to turn my dryer and washer on the same way I\\'m able to turn it off. The remote start option seems pointless because machine has to stay on to use this option defeating the concept of energy saving anyway... The alerts are great, would be cool to create your own musical alerts..This App had such promise but not needing able took remotely start the appliances or set the wash/dry cycle without first getting it all set up on the appliance and setting remote start on, on the appliance defeats the object of having an app. The only useful feature is the push notification when the cycle is done, but this does not really add any value..\"No problem with the product could be found.\"  Our fridge quit working.  60¡Æ in the freezer, water and melted popsicles and melted ice cream and spoiled milk and... basically everything in the freezer and the refrigerator is ruined.  The app connects just fine, but apparently it doesn\\'t consider it a problem when the refrigerator stops keeping things cold.  What is the point of advertising a feature that is supposed to be \"smart,\" yet can\\'t detect an error when the refrigerator is not able to do the ONE THING it is designed to do?.have only had our LG washing machine for one day so we are still getting to know all the features but the app is a new experience and will hopefully be used frequently, the app seems like a great idea and should add flexibility of use to our machine. the app is fairly intuitive but it would be nice to see the energy use in kw/h rather than just a graph with no scale, also would be nice to see actual water usage per wash as well as cumulative figures for water and electricity thus the 4 * rating..I only use this app with a washer and dryer. It works as advertized, but I would like to see more. Pros: You can see how many minutes are left in the cycle, start and stop the machines, and get a notification when the cycle ends. There are also special cycle and diagnostic functions that I don\\'t use. Cons: Can\\'t see the machine after the cycle ends, useful in the case of errors like unbalanced load. Alexa doesn\\'t give an end of cycle notification and can only see one machine at a time.Along with several others that have downloaded this app, I too have been experiencing several issues with this app. I have used multiple email accounts to try to log in to this app, and all has failed. I have multiple LG products which I cannot even access remotely as a result of a login error. Very disappointing....Awesome but want a quicker wash.I thought it was ridiculous for a washer/dryer to have WiFi built in because I could never see the need to start the washing machine remotely. However, our washer and dryer are in the basement, and I\\'ve found this app to be very useful in notifying me when the washer or dryer is finished. Overall using this app had been a positive experience..Very slow app, no API for home assistant, need to remote enable (somewhat understand that), rooted phone it wont boot (proven when using root hide apps, works again), like honestly LG the point is to integrate not separate. This kind of mentality will not keep you in the IoT game very long -- look at GE integrating with Google Assistant. A simple command should be made available to the assistant. \"Hey Google, is my fridge open?\" But no :(.Killing my battery!!! (Note 9) I installed this app to go with our new washer. Didn\\'t give us much functionality, why would I load the washer, then walk away and remote start it? The downloaded cycles didn\\'t seem to differ from the installed ones. Worse part the app was draining my battery big time, yet was somehow hiding it from the system. Was trying to figure out what was causing the issue, remembered this app was new, uninstalled it and my power usage was normal again..I like this app in that it notifies me when the load is done. It needs many more features. Remote start never works properly, if at all . I wish it had a reminder or snooze function when it notifies that the load is done but my biggest complaint is that it will not stay connected to the internet & washer!.This app is good and I installed it and it set it up nicely without any hiccups with my vivo Y69 android phone. But after I connected my ac using iPad, the app on android phone started acting weird. I uninstalled it and reinstalled the app on my android phone and it is showing Service Message which states \" Service check is restricting app usage and blah blah blah....\" and app is closing. What is this? Can you help me to reset the wifi settings of the ac?.I believe that the smart diagnosis feature on LG products is very usefull and they should continue using this feature from now on. However the app is irritably glitchy; it takes forever for the app to load and there are times when the app crashes altogether. this has been a problem for quite sometime and I wish LG would resolve this as soon as possible. When the smart diagnosis does works it is very helpfull it gives me the problems and the solutions right then and there..Like other reviewers it would be better to have more control starting and setting of the washing machine remotely rather than having to go to the machine every time. Ideally we should be able present the settings and just turn the washer on and send the settings directly. Otherwise its great to be able to monitor the process and see energy usage etc. Update 12/01/19, Noticed delay start via app now works! Thank you!.I like the app since it gives me the option to start the machine and monitor the progress remotely. A really nice feature the only the app can provide is the wrinkle prevention/fresh care option. on the negatives, the app is very sluggish and does not instantly update the machine progress. I have to back up to the intial app page and select the machine to get an accurate status update..I cannot use the app. After starting, and connect with google account, the screen shows \" Downloading the product information... Please wait\" and remains stuck on that. I\\'ve been trying from several devices (Samsung S9, Oppo Find7, etc.) with the same result. ... after several hours... Downloaded information..but a waste of time, not much info about Cycles ( time for cleaning, how many rise, does dry.. ). I have LG in all my house: TVs, fridges, washing machine, but I will change all of them..A pretty much unless app. Whats the point of remote access to your washer & dryer if once any cycle finishes it stops your remote access? REALLY! Also you have to turn on the wifi function everytime you turn on the machines. So to sum it up, you have to be standing in front of the washer & dryer to power it on, and to turn on the WiFi so you can connect to it remotely to see what you set it up to do while standing there. Once finished you start all over again! Skip LG WiFi not worth the $$!.This app wants crazy permissions. Ability to control phone calls, ability to turn on and off your phone\\'s wifi, requires your date of birth. On top of that it repeatedly said I don\\'t have internet, which is false. Does not save router password so you have to enter it every time. Garbage. Probably a scam. All I want to do is know when the dryer load is done. With how much trouble this is I\\'ll just use a timer.this app is the absolute worst. i have it for my washer. the menus are non-existent. it\\'s just poking at random buttons until you happen upon what you\\'re looking for. literally the ONLY reason i bought this washer is because it stated it had a \"delicate\" cycle in the specs. come to find out, this is actually a \"lingerie\" cycle in the app to download to the machine. and it\\'s no longer available. sick..Perfect application I really like it and enjoying.My wife and I both have Pixel 2 devices and mine works without issue. Wife\\'s phone it wont work as it says the device is rooted. Its not rooted and the bootloader is still locked.  Very frustrated by the fact that this app checks for rooted devices and will not clearly say how it is checking for that so that I can properly troubleshoot it..interesting features, I like how you can download different cycles for the dryer and washer. you can also remotely start the dryer and washer from this app, what I was hoping for though was to be able to set a time, or timer for when you want your cycle to start. a remote start feature is more of a novelty then anything youstill have to click go. if you could set a timer for say 08:00 the next morning then that would really make this technology the most useful in my opinion.Was connected and working fine. Then my app just stopped communicating to my heatpump. My WiFi access point see its connected and working fine, but the app on my phone says it can\\'t register it when trying to connect... UPDATE ,had to delete the app and reinstall it. Works good now, still very slow communications when you first open the app, but when it\\'s fully communicating it works very fast..It\\'s actually more convenient to just walk down two flights of stairs from my office to my basement than it is to setup this app. My phone has to be positioned perfectly with an icon on the washer and near as I can tell the shadows of ancient monuments in east Asia also have to line up under the summer equinox, because the correct positioning of the phone vs washer seems to change and when found will throw up its hands and have a problem just to have a problem..Doesn\\'t work on rooted phones. Barely let\\'s you do anything with washer and dryer remotely. And the appliance has to be turned and left on to remote connect. And you have to turn on \"remote start\" every time the appliance is turned off. It asks for too many permissions that it doesn\\'t really need..Worst privacy policy. Hardest to use. Primary purpose is to spy on customers. Believe it or not, you actually have to give LG the right to make phone calls on your behalf in order to install the app. And if for some reason LG thinks you are in another country than what you are, you need to get yourself a new email account to register a new account to use your LG products. Tedious. Unless of course you want to give them access to your Facebook account, good luck with that....I had a lot of difficulty in connecting my AC to the app. after about 15 to 20 tries, it connected. Next day it again showed the status if the AC as disconnected. It again took several attempts to connect. But again the next day it shows as disconnected and not connecting again. Also, why does this app turn on bluetooth on my phone?.Bought a new 55\" TV and can\\'t connect it to anything because this bloody app doesn\\'t work. Everyone you try to setup the TV to use this it just sits there saying nothing is connected. Why can\\'t it just work like the older LG TVs. What\\'s the point in having a smart TV if it\\'s dumber than a box of nails..Total rubbish!!! Can\\'t even log in! The create account by LG (website) forced my email to set leading case to create the account. Then this silly app refuses to accept it as it is leading case (instead of converting to all lower as default)!!! So one hand is fighting the other hand at LG!!!! I raised it with LG support but they can\\'t be bothered to resolve it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.Does not connect to LG wall mounted AC unit. After enabling the wifi connection on the unit and confirming it is on in the app by clicking YES, all I get is a loading page with PLEASE WAIT. Nothing happens. Wifi connectivity is one of the main reasons we bought the LG AC unit, feeling very disappointed. Reinstalling app did nothing to resolve the issue. Android webview is upto date. Mobile data switch disabled. I\\'ve checked every single possibility - still nothing..On the weekend I bought a dual washer and dryer. This app handy in that you can look at how long till the wash is complete and it\\'ll notify me when it\\'s done. Improvements would be the ability for the app to send me a notice it is done and the option to continue and dry my items (depending on the wash setting). Not being able to connect when the machines are turned off restricts the set up via the app..So why do you prevent this app from running on a rooted phone? This is the ONLY app that I have tried to run that has complained about my phone being rooted. fix this! Then LG responded, due to some security reasons, really, even my banking apps run on my rooted phone, please explain LG. There is no reason to prevent this. How about giving the user the option, like asking a question, \"do you really want to use this app on you rooted phone?\" One of the selling points was this app, fix this..Unfortunately the last update broke the ability to set up scheduled changes to A/C. It\\'s additionally very slow. LG should open their API to better apps and services if they can\\'t build one themselves..What business is it of yours if my phone is rooted? You don\\'t have permission to check my phone for administrator rights! I bet you scanned my phone to see all the apps I have installed without me too! Shame on you LG After reading the reviews I\\'m glad this app doesn\\'t work. Thanks for saving me the headache of using this garbage.Push notifications have never worked, it\\'s the very least you\\'d expect from a WiFi enabled product. Registering using a Huawei P20 Pro does not work. 1 out of 10 times, I could provide the home WiFi details, but it would never get further than 40% complete. Luckily I was able to use a Sony Xperia to complete the registration, then log in using the same account on the Huawei phone. Not an ideal UX..For whatever reason, I\\'ve stopped getting notifications that my wash/dryer cycles are done. super frustrating. I\\'ve force closed the app, cleared the app storage, uninstalled/reinstalled the app and still not working properly. All i want is the notifications so if I\\'m not home or in a different part of the house, I have a reminder that there\\'s laundry to be dealt with..It requests too many permissions! LG responds it needs \"Make calls and call settings\" in order to identify country and language. BUT at the same time app requests LOCATION? Please, use location info and a lot of 3d party services to convert location into country info! If even it is not possible, live filling country and language info to user. Believe, we will cope with it..It\\'d be nice if we could actually use the functions of the app like downloading new cycles to use. But considering every single time it says that it can\\'t because we\\'re not connected, despite the wifi showing on and remote start available, we\\'re unable to download cycles. So yeah, that\\'s very frustrating..Doesn\\'t work... installed and uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times. Go through the registration but when I click on my stove the app freezes and I have to force stop. It\\'s like it never fully downloads my oven and the app just shows a bunch of gibberish where I assume the product\\'s info would appear... glad I sprang the extra money on useless bluetooth functionality. So far not impressed with LG..I have smart fridge, washing machine and vacuum. All have problem connecting to the app except the vacuum. I tried for hours and days trying to connect to the fridge and washing machine with my P20 Pro but failed! This app sucks very bad!!!! I took out my old LG G4 to sync the app with the fridge and washing machine, and it worked! The app should have worked with all newer android phone!.I installed this to use with my refrigerator. It keeps telling me it will not run on a rooted device. My phone is not rooted. I bought an unlocked phone directly from HTC. This is ridiculous. Update: 01/23/2019 A previous update now shows me to use the app on my phone. The app features are great now that I am able to use it. I changed my rating from 1 star to 5. This is a great app..I live in the same country where our LG appliances were purchased. However, I cannot connect to the only official version of the app available to me. There is no way in the app to change my region or location even though I turned my GPS on like the app asked me too. I cannot program anything for our washer, dryer, or styler. I cannot put delicate natural materials (fur, leather) into the styler because some functions require a connected app, which is a huge design flaw..There\\'s no good reason why this app should require call permissions. Overall pretty simple app that lets me control my washing machine and fridge. I can download new washing programs or set the temperature, and the notifications are a nice touch. Wifi diagnostics for the fridge always fails, but audio diagnostics works and it helped me figure out that the fridge was in defrosting mode so that\\'s why I couldn\\'t hear it working. The English copy in some screens contains grammar mistakes..I was so excited about my LG washer and dryer that was delivered today. But if I knew my app would be stuck on the \"downloading product information\" screen I would have just went with the Samsung set. I\\'ve uninstalled the app and re-downloaded it, it still doesn\\'t work. May call and return my products tomorrow. Sad cause I had such high Hope\\'s. My last set of LG washer and dryer worked for over 12 years..The idea behind this is awesome and really helpful. I use this app for a washing machine and i do like the fact that i have so many programs to choose from. However, it lacks some features: i wish i had some kind of a description for the programmes and the amount of time they take-you can only see this on the machine when you download the program. A favourites kind of feature would be useful too and maybe having the possibility to monitor the washing cycle while it goes..When using this app for a heat pump why can\\'t we set the temperature when using the the on/off timer, it only uses the laat temperature that was set? I would like to automatically set a time when I\\'m not home to a lower temperature and then have it higher when I\\'m home. The way it is now the weekly timer is useless..Remote controling is only do ON & OFF and cycle selection process, modification of cycle is not controllable via this app, for eg: if I want to increase temp, need extra rinse, need extra spin. So this functions are uncontrollable, or may be LG should provide a guide to run this app online (kind of navigator) and also please update the app so it takes less space in device.A little lag in establishing connection with my wifi enabled split air units. The biggest pain point is the schedule feature. It does not operate at all. In other words, setting a time to turn on and off does not work. The unit remains off, even though I can hear an audible ring after confirming the settings..Bit poorly laid out, awkward menus. Main issue is a notification from it, e.g. washing complete, keeps the phone screen on constantly. Someone else uses washer and I discover my phone hours later at 4% battery. Had to turn off notifications. But that was the point of it, to know when my washing is done. Stupid..The app is slow, when you click on the washing machine/download cycles nothing happens. Usually have to click a couple of times before it opens the options to download cycles. It just shows the cycle names but it doesn\\'t give more information like how long it takes or the temperature. There is no setting for towels, the short wash also takes a really long time. My previous washing machine had a 15min cycle which was awesome. I also wish we could customise our own cycles.App not reponding after the last update..Good and simple.difficult to navigate.There is so much promise that is unrealized with this app. I connect everything I must house with my Google Home and have come to expect a certain amount of functionality. I can use this app with Google to change the temp in my fridge, turn ice plus on but can\\'t run my 78\" LG TV or start my LG connected dryer unless I pushed a button on the dryer to specifically allow remote start. This is a good start but needs a lot work to truly connect with my Google home..I am only able to select the cycle but I cannot select the options for Wash, Rinse, Spin, Temperature, dry, etal. I\\'m usong an LG G4. It\\'s also unfortunate that I have to switch on remote start from the machine. It would have been epic if I could switch on the machine and remote start from the App..They steal your personal information. I just want to scan the fride for error code. They wont let you use the app if you are not willing to give up your private info (location, calls and messages), while its often unnecessary for the users to give those permissions. If you want to know the country or language, just ask in a page, dont ask for full permissions to spy on people..Buggy. Current version fails to declare its \"notification channel\". LG developers would know this, if they ran their own app with all the debug alerts enabled. (Or maybe try this thing called \"testing\", LG. Ask around. It\\'s a good thing, unless you don\\'t want to know about your bugs.) Edit: Raised to 3 stars. Because they\\'re still better than Samsung. (I\\'ve a pixel 2. Stock. Fully upgraded.).Good but I\\'ve 2 issues with it that are deal breakers: (1) the app lacks any form of automation by itself (say, turn on air-conditioning when temp is 29) and (2) integration with other automation app like IFTTT, Google Home or Alexa is regional and sadly our region hasn\\'t been supported still. As it is, it can only turn on/off air-conditioning and after the coolness factor has worn off, to me, until automation is supported, it\\'s nothing but a novelty app..We bought our washer in July & I loved the Smart Thinq app. Since an upgrade in the app I have been unable to connect it. I have done everything conceivably possible (including a page from an answer another review)& still can\\'t get connected. My router needs an extender to reach, that address has an underscore I can\\'t change, & is the only thing I can figure is causing the prob. My washer is downstairs, & my kids do their own laundry making this ability convenient. Please, help me fix this bug..I\\'m using LG 9kg Heat pump dryer TD-H9066WS. It connect easily and pair with apps, the apps show how many cycle does the dryer used every month, type of drying menu used, wireless start stop and pause. But there is a small things that I found, when the dryer estimate to finish 14minutes, I\\'m click pause using apps and the dryer pause as it should be but it resumes to 20 minutes to compete dry. That\\'s all. Everything else, nice.This app is useless. Just purchased a new refrigerator with wifi capability. LG had an outdated email address on file. I spent 40 minutes on phone to restore login credentials. Owners Manual insert had the wrong app name. Downloaded updated app and then could not login with new credentials. Purchased from Costco, whose support is excellent, and they were unable to work with the app. Now attempting to exchange \"smart\" frig for a GE model....This is thr most useless app in the world. What\\'s the point of remote start? You have to enable it every time you run it. As soon as the cycle ends, you lose your ability to do anything remotely and even after the dryer is turned back on, you have to hold down the button to re-enable remote start. This is the most useless feature but should be the best. It is the feature that sold me on your dryer. What\\'s the point?.Works ok but very slow to connect to my LG air conditioner. I would say there is a delay of around 30 secs between launching the App and being able to control the a/c. I have tried it on three devices including IOS and Android and they all do it. UPDATE 22 June 2019. I have updated my devices but there is still a delay of around 15s. I am using WiFi with a 200mbps connection so the problem is not due to my internet connection..I\\'m using it for a washer and dryer, and it\\'s pretty convenient to get alerts when loads are done (for as lazy as that may sound). It\\'d be nice if it had a widget for easier access to common features or statuses, and I\\'d really love the ability to program cycles in greater depth (and, to have custom programs as the default when each appliance is started)..Some features missing. As of today, u can turn off the light for the ac with the app or alexa skill. You can\\'t schedule for anything less than 1 hour. So if the ac needs to be on, it has to be for an hour. I want it to be set to any value in minutes. Plus if I want to turn on or off the ac in different times of the night... I can only do a on - off. I can\\'t do a on-off-on-off etc.cool thing to change settings but it would be nice to be able to get things like actual temp inside the until instead of just what it is set to on the door..Can\\'t run on a rooted phone.. Really,, devs need to realise that it\\'s not some mission critical banking app..i did not think that i needed a washer and dryer with wifi but after purchasing a laundry pair i will not go back. This feature has allowed me to determine extactly when my clothes are ready to be dried or folded down to the second. I can match up the cycle counts per month to determine how much detergent to purchase and to finally budget for these expenses. The app does have a couple of flaws... My washer drops off the wifi while the dryer stays on. The device polling time is slow. Good start..Tried to connect a LG C8 TV with Google home trough the app like described on LG website. However, when pressing (+)add on the app TVs are not even listed as category. Way too complex and many steps and I\\'m a rather tech savvy. How are older people supposed to set this up? Probably not... Turns out LG changed its mind (hence the old manual on their website) and only allows Google home integration and sign up directly from a menu within the TV..Not terrible but expected more. App will control washer, but will only start it if washer is powered on and you select the remote start option. So basically useless for that functionality. The notifications are nice. You cant change the washer cycle if someone else starts it. Its not overly intuitive. My washer doesnt need to tell me the weather, because my thermostat, computer, tv, and phone already do that. The description for this app says stop wasting time with chores, but to effectly use the app, it takes more time than to actually push the buttons at the washer..Invasive permissions required to operate my LG AC unit. Call, photos....what the he__. Also, do not believe the app connects directly to unit through app when connected to Wi-Fi, but goes through a LG server to connect. NO, not for me. I\\'d like to keep the connection direct from app on phone through my Wi-Fi to AC unit. No LG server..UX is generally bad, most options and features aren\\'t explained.  Why does Bluetooth turn on when app is opened? You can turn that off, but it doesn\\'t explain why you\\'d want it on  Modes: What do they do?  Why does it say \"Airconditioner Alert\" when clicking on a mode?  I haven\\'t tested it much, but the App doesn\\'t really tell me how it can be helpful to me.i really wish you could give it it\\'s own notification sound, but it just uses the default so i often miss or ignore it. sometimes it doesn\\'t even notify me at all until i open the app and it\\'s been 30 min gone by. other times, even with the app open it just sits there spinning until i tap the actual appliance. so it\\'s a bit annoying, but when it works properly it\\'s very nice..Although it explains why, it asks for unreasonable permissions like making and managing phonecalls that it should be able to function without. After that there\\'s no functionality without creating an LG account. Just not worth it to me.  Update: The developer\\'s response to my review just proves my point as to why I uninstalled the app. Asking to be able to make/manage phone calls to determine my country is an abuse of that permission and violation of my privacy. Same with requesting fine-grained location just to access WiFi. If they can\\'t trust me to tell them what country I live in, why should I trust them with such broad permissions? This might be a good app, but is burdened with permissions issues that make it not worth installing in my opinion. Your mileage may vary though..This app is amazing. my laundry room in on the second floor, and when im crazy busy and dont want to run upstairs to see if laundry is done. I just open the app. Makes my life so much more easier. No longer running up the stairs to see if it\\'s done and then seeing there\\'s 5 minutes left, and running back down the stairs. and hoping I remember 5 minutes later that laundry is done..I\\'ve just bought an American style fridge freezer, connected the app...I can set the temperature of the fridge and freezer and...that\\'s it. Now you\\'d THINK that one of the kinda useful things to know would be what the temperature ACTUALLY IS!!!!  Nope, it won\\'t do that, however it will tell me the weather in my location and the outside temperature, should I wish to venture out.  FFS, there are a million ways to find out the temperature outside and the last place I will look is on my fridge/freezer app but c\\'mon, ffs, tell me the temperature INSIDE THE BLOODY THING.  That\\'s the ONE thing that this app should be doing!  The appliance will have temperature sensors so the data is there, the appliance already communicates with the app for diagnostic and firmware info but seriously, what part of \"YOU HAVE ONE TASK\" isn\\'t clear here?   TELL ME THE ACTUAL TEMPERATURE INSIDE THE APPLIANCE..I use this app for one appliance only (washer). I like having a notification for the end of wash. I was spoiled to my previous version of my LG washer with a custom program & became excited to see I could download one. Unfortunately, these settings are preset and not editable through the app to download. So instead of making a cycle setting for one button push, I have to make changes to the closest setting I\\'ve downloaded. A custom setting like on the WT5001CW would be awesome!.Most frustrating app ever!! Tried to set up regular schedule for ac unit. I\\'d set it to start at 4pm, save, then back up to menu and it would show starting at 5pm. I tried to anticipate a time zone issue when creating other schedules. I\\'d save a new one at 3pm, then it would push the first schedule to a new time, and save the current one at a different time. Worst programming ever. Worthless. I bought a Wi-Fi enabled power plug to schedule on on the plug and bypass the worthless LG app..Why don\\'t let the user customize washer cycles from the app? That would be very useful and productive. If I need to customize a cycle I have to access the washer panel directly, and this is a no sense since the app could do it. Please improve the app, you can do it..cant connect to google home.Cannot get the app to work on Google Pixel 2 with latest version of Android 9. When I enter my email address and pwd, always get the message - Network Instability - No response from the server. Try again later. Have tried this over many days with same result. Very frustrating! Also, have the exact same problem on my Samsung tablet! Just got update, re-installed - same problem!.This app is s big waste of my time!! I bought a $3000 refrigerator with wifi for the sole purpose of connecting it with the smart thinQ app. Well this app is not smart at all!! I have repeaters in my house.and one directly across from the refrigerator!! I have an IP cam right across from my refrigerator and that works fine, so I know it isn\\'t a problem with my wifi. I had it connected once and it worked for awhile but quit!! If I had know LG products don\\'t work well with their apps or play well with Amazon echo, I wouldn\\'t have spent the outrageously high prices on their appliances!!.AC only showing disconnected. Worked few hours and sometimes works after outer unit defrost seqence. Nothing helps, to get it connect again than just wait. there is nothing wrong with my router and all needed ports are open for AC on router. Really need help with this. When app works it\\'s fun and useful but 95% of time it does not connect..Works with top washer 7300 & dryer 7250. Conneting to my WiFi was a bit challenging as my network is top security type. I was able to get around this once I was able to discover the MAC address for both appliances. I would have appreciated if LG would had provided these MAC address\\'s. So I had to disable my network security in order to discover those addresse\\'s. After that I reinstated the network security and gave access to both LG appliances. Only then was this app able to recognize both..Unlike the previous version, this latest version of the LG app is really pretty good. It was easy to set up and I like the updates. The temperature now shows up in Fahrenheit, which is great for us Americans. It\\'s a very simple and easily understood app that does indeed offer some value..Awful! This app is glitchy, randomly logs you out, and is so hard to use. I really wish LG would overhaul this terrible app! We have an LG washer and dryer and when the app works it is handy for checking on laundry, but getting the app to actually work is the problem. Should have gotten the Samsung washer and dryer!.Buying a washer/dryer that doesn\\'t give you the option of having a simple \"rinse&spin\" already predownloaded is really uncomfortable. Every time I try to download it from the app, it simply times out and I get so frustrated (usually after 10\\' of failed attempts) and simply end up rewashing the clothes with a \"fast\" available program...Can\\'t even add it to favorites for when it decides to allow me to download it. Practically can\\'t use any downloadable program. Thats really not cost effective..Downloaded the app to set up my Smart ThinkQ refrigerator but the app is not working. Tried to register my product multiple times but it failed so I decided to reinstall the app hoping it\\'d fix the bugs but it got worse. The app flashes a log in failed message on start up and whenever I select the retry button, the screen loads then the same message appears. Apparently getting a Smart ThinkQ refrigerator is useless because of the buggy app..I am not really sure what this app is supposed to do. I bought the LG washer WT7500C and Dryer DLEX7600, i have the NFC turned on on my phone and was able to register the products and that\\'s about it. app says i can download cycles but doesnt give me any options to download. Is it supposed to allow me run my washer and dryer from afar? keep track of what they are doing? other than monitoring any service issues, which i am not hoping to have use to often, not sure what i am using the app for....I used it to connect my lg fridge freezer, but to be honest its not very functional. Why can\\'t be shown on the app the current live temperatures in the fridge freezer? The only thing i can see is the target. I wan to see what is the temperature in my fridge. It\\'s so simple.think first before buying an LG product to use with this app. This is one of the worst home automation apps available. It takes no less than 20 seconds to even see the air conditioning unit that is turned on and connected to Wi-Fi. it takes even longer when the unit is off. When using the Google Assistant on any device connected to my home network, it cannot turn on the A/C because it takes so long for the app and air conditioner to talk to each other..Can\\'t browse available washing cycles when I\\'m not connected. Not nice when I have some time on my commute and instead I\\'ll have to read what\\'s available when I\\'m home and should just start my laundry and go do some other stuff. App igmores it\\'s connected to the machine with Polish labels printed on it. Not a problem for me but I can see how it could be disappointing for people from my mother\\'s generation. Selection of programs is decent, but lacks \"sports shoes\" and some are redundant..after last redesign/update, some options for AC were removed and when I try to add/edit schedule, I got only \"retry for normal operation\". The same in settings of AC unit section. Tried to reinstall app, another LG account, pair AC units again, no success. So I am stuck with schedule and settings from 2 weeks ago without option to change it.. but basic functions as temperature, fan speed are working ok..Stopped connecting to server, after multiple data clears and reinstallations. Works on wife\\'s phone but I am the laundry meister in this house. I have wasted a lot of time trying to get this app to work..Very useful for washers and dryers.Don\\'t know why, but this app will not connect to my Alexa app. Not impressed with this LG App.I\\'m not willing to give an app permissions to make phone calls just so i can control my washer and dryer. Could have been a neat featuer, but not at the expense of giving some company control of my phone. The good old buttons on the device will work just fine.  Edit: I am a developer and this response is either total BS or laziness on the part of their engineers (or both). There are a multitude of ways you could have the bulk of your app functionality working without these permissions (including using self-reported locations, disabling some features when location isn\\'t available, or more specific location services permissions (ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION or ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION) without full phone call capabilities. And that\\'s just to name a few)..Great app for my ductless units. It was super easy to pair and navigate. I have had them installed for 2 months without issues with connection. I just noticed the temperature setting is showing 2 degrees higher on the app than on the remote, must be a big. It would be great to have alerts if there was a temperature drop below the setting..Convenient to have app notify us as soon as they are finished so don\\'t have to watch a clock while in another room. Washer dryer WiFi also turns Off while they are Off so does not intefer with other WiFi devices. Bought the big 7 cuft dryer washer combination and they do a large load fast. So need this app to keep up with them so the washer dryer are not waiting on us. App also provides a countdown until finished which helps planning when needed at washer dryer to move clothes..The app doesn\\'t even stay open, just shuts down after a popup saying: Network instability, no response from the server, try again later. No support for the message can be found anywhere on the internet...  EDIT: I had to clear the app data and in the end I got it working but then I discovered the fridge was delivered broken and the smart diagnosis was not picking it up. Also would have much easier troubleshooting the issue is there was any way of getting the current fridge temperature (on the fridge or in app)...get notification no matter where you are... at work, out gardening etc. app works great! set laundry and head to work then start remotely 1 hour before getting home and laundry is ready for the dryer when you get home...sweet! I\\'m always working late or stopping to get groceries so I arrive home at different times... app starting works better for me than time delay. Thank you LG!.This app is good. Im using 7kg washer 5kg dryer. The Download Cycle all good, the only thing is the Description of each cycle is not loaded automatically. This is the only bug, it shows the Description when i click \"?\" button on Download Cycle Help. Please fix this and your apps just great, really. Thanks.Last October when we bought our new washer and dryer I was looking for one with wifi that would alert me when each load was done. This app does exactly that and so much more! I love all of the features that this app has. It\\'s very convenient being able to control my washer and dryer with my phone. Plus all of the info that they give you to help keep your appliances in good working order is very important to me. my favorite thing is being able to check the time left on a load from my phone..On latest update & trying to control 4 air conditioners. Upon opening the app it takes perhaps 30/40seconds before the products load & you can control them, very long delay. Also keep getting some units saying \"disconnected\" so have to force close app & reopen to reconnect. You can only adjust temperature in increments or 1.0c even though on my wall controller I can go in increments of 0.5c. Have deleted & re-added the units to try fix the slowness and disconnection issues. Improvement needed!.the app is pretty limited in features and is locked down for how i hoped is be able to use it. I\\'d like to be able to modify cycles and remotely start, but you can only do that if you physically set it to remote start. it\\'s great for notifications that a cycle is complete, but that\\'s about it for value..For air conditioner control, there needs to be a tactile and / or visible cue that user has successfully pushed the power button in the app, as currently it\\'s impossible to tell if you\\'ve hit it or missed it. Also, it takes far too long for app to connect to air conditioner. Finally, consider changing name of app to \"LG SmartThinq\" as i forget name of app 100 percent of time I\\'m looking for it, assuming the app name would start with \"LG.\".OK but not quite what I expected. Finally got it connected using Android. I couldn\\'t get it to play nicely with ios. I would like to see the model number, access manual, be able to customise wash cycles, etc. from within the app. It does tell me when a cycle has finished and I can start the machine remotely, which are both useful..Application is helpful but few issues they should take care. 1. i should be able to remote start always when machine is connected to wifi. 2. i should be able to customize default wash+dry with washer time and dryer time. 3 energy consumption not showing when u directly use washer rather app. 4. time it shows is not correct. machine always take 1 hour more time to finish then what it shows..Great app. User friendly..Efficient and reliable..Very long loading, tried on two devices. Needs to download information when registering a product, and then freezes. Says that there is server error connecting, but in that moment my network is online. Tried to use other network, but also cant download information. Frustrated and disapointed..Please bring the last version back. It used to work great! Since the last update, I haven\\'t received any notifications at all. Uninstalled and reinstalled, still no notifications which are set to on. Why does the new version automatically turn on bluetooth everytime you open the app? Last version didn\\'t need bluetooth. App used to send me notifications even if I were miles away from home. App still shows machine status and time which is good, but I need notifications to work again..App gives redundant information (weather), but not helpful information, like which filters my refrigerator needs. Lets me adjust settings remotely and tells me when the dryer is done, which is nice. Just doesn\\'t feel very \"smart\"; lots of room to make it more useful and helpful..update to dev team: I\\'m not so dis-satisfied with wifi issues so much that this ecosystem you\\'ve developed, it\\'s like an alexa competitor, but it\\'s not, & also it\\'s compatible with alexa, with 18 servers involved, & you would have had privacy on your side but then you made it worse with no opt-outs... don\\'t get me wrong, I can see the logic in the planning of preheating something or other. Until a lawsuit happens. BTW I noticed the life-shortening wind-down firmware update. just jots off now..My ac unit has \"sleep mode\" but this is not an option i can control with the app. There are connectivity issues using wifi remote, even when I\\'m home and using a good strong connection. The app (wifi control) and the remote control supplied with the unit don\\'t play well together. If i use the app, and then the remote when I\\'m home they pick different settings rather than finding what they are previously set at on unit itself. Hope you fix it all. ??.this app thinks the phone is rooted and wont work... the only app I\\'ve seen do this. Not even banking apps ... inferior technology the permisisons they ask for are not needed. the excuse LG gives here is false. they dont need to verify location, they don\\'t need to verify storage space, they don\\'t need to verify country. No legitimate app does this. LG is definitely collecting your info and selling it..Update: Uninstalled and reinstalled from the app store. Looks like it might be working now. Previously: Terrible. Thought this feature was a reason to purchase an air conditioner, but after it performed an auto firmware update, (minutes after the initial download of app) it could no longer connect to my WIFI. I wasted over 30 minutes of time trying to get it to reconnect, including uninstalling and reinstalling the app..We have been using the app for about 2 weeks with an LG 14,000btu portable air conditioner. The app has the On/Off switch, low/high fan, temperature setting with target and actual room temperature, mode switch for AC cool, fan and dehumidifier. Also has the air vent swing mode switch. All switches and settings have worked properly and we are very happy with it. Alexa controls On/Off and temperature settings..Works great with google home..convenient. love new functions.what a horrible app. what good is having something like this when you cant even start the appliance from the app? I can see it running and know how much time is left but cant pause. stop or start a cycle. seems pretty worthless. i thought the whole purpose of this app was to remotely control the appliance which means turning it on, starting a cycle etc. cant do any if that here. dont waste time with this. pointless. so much for a smart appliance.Not very intuitive but once you get the hang of things it works well for what it is. Best features are the smart diagnosis and the ability to download new wash cycles. The smart diagnosis detected that my plumbing is backwards, hot water thru the cold water pipe and vice versa. Easy fix and working like a charm ever since. Also it pings my smartphone when the load is finished. Sweet!.App won\\'t add TV, it says check for Web OS 4 or higher, the TV has it. Then it asks to select Google or Amazon, neither appear on the TV. So it just stops there. I can\\'t change the region of the TV or of the phone app. The phone app looks like it will change but only gives one country and language option. It\\'s terribly frustrating to go in circles following the instructions. The TV\\'s Web OS and phone OS are capable, just the software is disabled..This has to be the worst app I have ever used..Over an hour spent waisting my time and it still does not work..This goes along with problems with the washer too..6 months old and had to be replaced after numerous repair attemps and now will not function as it is supposed too..This was a almost a 4000.00 set to boot.. Thanks L.G. for a great product !!.The app mostly worked until the most recent update. Now we\\'re lucky to get 1 out of 10 push notifications. Tried uninstalling/reinstalling and re-doing the wifi setup, but still almost useless now. Update: So after 3 weeks of a completely non-functional app, LG has finally released an update that at least restores it to its previous level of functionality. Update 2 (6/23): Broke again. Back to the old version for good since that at least works..I was under the impression I could operate my washer and dryer remotely from this app. I cannot and only seem to have the option to do a diagnosis EDIT Thank you LG for reviewing my feedback. I had the chance to go through my settings and test out the features! It works wonderfully - love that I can program the washer to go off X number of hours (although it would be nice if there was an option to just program the desired time). Count down on washer/dryer is great too..SmartThinQ API being closed source, blocks me from using my device in my own local network without this crappy cloud solution. Can\\'t add my air conditioner to the app. Tried several times with mixed results - sometimes it adds it but says \"Registration failed\", the other time it claims it\\'s \"Updating firmware\"... Still ending up with using remote controller. What\\'s more, I cannot use SmartThinQ with Google Home in Poland. \"Service not available in your region\". Worst experience ever!.Not much use. We\\'ve noticed by using an internal thermometer that our LG fridgefreezer temperature goes up and down wildly. I was hoping this app would identify why but it doesn\\'t really give any indication of what the product does. Only thing it ever tells you about is when it runs a defrost occasionally..Invasive, unnecessary permissions. In the comments they say they need permission to manage and make phone calls just to determine your country? Just have a screen with a drop down menu like most other apps..Utterly useless. Wanted to use the app for my washer/dryer, but there are no useful downloadable cycles, only really obscure and esoteric settings that cthulu might want to use to launder his delicates. In terms of time saved I\\'d like to give this app 0 stars because it only cost time to figure out how useless it is. \"Smart\" my a**..I like that I get alerts when the load is down as I live in a four level house and cant hear the washer or dryer and get distracted by kids often. It sucks you have to hit remote start on the unit for this to work also annoying you cant cancel and select a different cycle i accidentally pressed the wrong button and couldn\\'t fix it..I cant register my non wifi appliances now that they have changed this to wifi only. My washer and dryer both had no issues using the download cycle with NFC tag until i had ti reinstal this app. Now it requires me ti register my washer and dryer again but suprise, it needs tinhave wifi built into my machines. My machines are not wifi equipted. Hiw stupi is it to remove functionality on an appliiance that is less than 2 yrs old simply because they added additional features to the newer models..This app wants permission to access everything in my phone, which I consider excessive and a privacy and security risk. Why does my air conditioner need to access my photos, text, email, contacts, moicrophone, camera, storage, phone Bluetooth, and location? The only thing it should need is WiFi unless it\\'s spying on me. I had a little trouble getting my A/C to connect to WiFi but works well except it always turns Bluetooth on and doesn\\'t turn it off. I plan on removing most permissions!.Update to developer: I understand why the permissions, but request them at the time they\\'re needed. You can\\'t use the app w/o providing access to location and calling info. This is an app for my household appliances. I accept some features wont work without those permissions, but to not even launch w/o allowing permissions? No thanks. Allowing me to start the use of the app and ask for the permissions you need at the time that I\\'m attempting to use a feature that needs it..if you use LG products in your household then this app will control them all. I have my TV, dish washer, and washing machine and air conditioner all under control in a single app. you can even diagnose a particular device using the app and it will tell you if it has a problem that needs fixing. truly convenient and life simplified..this app is unbelievably worthless. there is only one possible use for having Wi-Fi connectivity to a washer: to create a custom downloaded cycle. instead of allowing you to do this the app creates 20 possible cycles of which you can download 1 to the washer. all I want is a simple cold wash with 2-3 additional rinses because my kid has eczema. this is not possible. all the preset cycles to select from are random and worthless. everybody online complains about the same thing. LG, please fix.One step forward, two steps back.  I\\'m using this app on Android to control a single air-conditioner. PROS: it controls the air-conditioner, from anywhere in the world, and lets me monitor indoor temperature. CONS: BRUTAL user interface that wastes a tonne of space. A recent update moves things around slightly, improving some, worstening others. I *wish* I could attach a screen capture - I even made a mockup of how the app could be improved with some minor UI/UX changes..My mother does not use an android phone in the house. She uses a tablet. Problem is this App is not compatible with android tablets. Bad planning on the developers part. Also this app is not so easy to setup with the appliances..Great application for smart TV.Won\\'t connect washer.I have an LG Tag On washer and dryer. the \"tagging\" location is inconveniently positioned in front of very sensitive cycle buttons. When trying to Tag the washer or dryer the buttons get pushed easily. The list of drying/washing options is very limited, and actually seems useless. the washing and drying modes I have selected (Normal) show in the app as \"This cycle does not exist anymore\". There are only 3 washing cycles available by size 1) Single item 2) Small 3) Winkle stop. (no med/Lg?).I\\'m really disappointed, I\\'ve bought a webOS television with a big advertisement that said \"Google Assistant compatible\" and here, in Spain, I can\\'t connect it to my Google home. What I should do, buy a Chromecast in a 2000¢æ television \"compatible with google assistant\"? Searching a little I\\'ve discovered that works only in USA. I love the television quality,but I\\'m thinking to returning it back. I\\'ve bought the TV hardware and the OS too and it\\'s not compatible as the advertisement said..I\\'m in app development and KNOW you don\\'t NEED my GPS location and personal data for device connectivity! DON\\'T LIE! One of the selling points for my $1000 dishwasher was you could connect to it through your phone. Yet after buying it the app refuses to work unless you grant it exact GPS location and personal info which is NOT necessary to simply connect a device to WiFi. I would\\'ve returned the washer if app was integral but the irony is the app is horrible so I\\'m uninstalling it. F*@& you LG!.This app is just LG farming personal information from customers. Needed every peice of personal info imaginable for an account. I just wanted to know why my washer had ue errors every load, now it wants me to register the washer to the account to use \"smart diagnosis\", because it would be horrable if the app would just talk to the washer 2 feet infront of it. (In advance) don\\' give me that \"to determine your country the app needs acsess to your call/photos/everything\" why do you need my country?.Difficult to commission Smart LG devices. Must turn off device firewall and disable 5G WiFi. AP does not install on: Nexus 7 and Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4. Privacy concerns include AP requires access to location and mobile calls. Not much functionality for all the hassle. Save yourself some time and skip this AP..This application does not allow you to select NFC , a number of the LG products only have NFC capability. This is really a non-starter.All your response did was take me back here with the same issue. Your application does not provide NFC option!!!!!! This really sucks..The app doesnt support connecting to my WiFi with a portable air conditioning unit that shows this icon and recommends this app in the instruction manual. With the correct credentials it keeps providing a login error. I suspect it isn\\'t switching to the 2.4 GHz channel because the two frequencies share an SSID..registration fails if your wifi password contains special characters (?!#@$&...).Is full of bugs, is not possible to add appliances with my Galaxy S10+ because it remains forever looking for it but with my Moto G it works, maybe is an incompatibility problem with Android 9. Smart Diagnosis is a gimmick, I run it with my washer (WD22TS6/WM5000HVA) and it gave me ever error because the door was open when it was not, the LG technical support told me that the Android app is giving too much problems, so don\\'t use Smart Diagnosis..Slow slow slow, every time open the app to setup timer for washer, I almost give up because it\\'s too slow to connect..Doesn\\'t work, asks for unlimited access to phone to run, doesn\\'t work for tag on.my oven refuses to register. the worst support I\\'ve ever seen. I saw LGs comment below. are you kidding me? you dont think I\\'ve tried this already? your app support is a complete joke. why is it your oven is the only thing out of 3 appliances that wont register? by the way, this stupid email address they\\'re telling you to email, they MIGHT reply to you once every week with useless things you\\'ve already done. it\\'s just not support AT ALL..The app isn\\'t allowing me to register my washer. I got a new phone (Samsung Galaxy S8) and in getting an error for the wifi. Its saying the device doesn\\'t support a 5.0 ghz, it needs 2.4 ghz. Not sure why this is s problem. It worked fine with my old phone and the same wifi..Works great but have to give it 1 star for too many permissions required, there\\'s absolutely no reason at all it needs access to phone, storage, and location to turn on an air conditioner so I have to go thru the frustration of revoking permissions everytime after using it.Using it for a refrigerator with water/air filter. It notified me that the filters need replacing but doesn\\'t give me a product #. Worse yet,.the app doesn\\'t tell me the fridge model # either. Had to actually pull out the manual to find out what to buy. Something this trivial shouldn\\'t be hard to find..LG portable air conditioner, app was working fine then the past few days, you cant adjust swivel or cooling temperature. you can only turn off and on. already tried uninstalling and reinstalling app with new update. using Samsung note 9 and iphone 6. its not working on both of my phones anymore right now. This eventually got fixed. Thank you.the app demands to be allowed to make calks and read call settings, allegedly to determine your preferred country and language settings. You should be able to find that some other way. An app I use to set the inadequate delay timer on my LG washing machine does not need to make phone calls.When this app works (for Alexa), it provides limited functionality. Nothing like described. But, the app rarely works. I re installed w no change. This function was one of the reasons I chose this LG TV. LG should not advertise this function until it works..it connects to our new refrigerator and you could conceivably change temps and other settings but why? it isn\\'t like I\\'ll be out of town and suddenly decide i want my fridge in 35 instead of 37. what it really needs to do is show the current operating temps and give notifications if they go out of range. in response, useless options to be made remotely. monitoring actual current temp is desired.you must take off your cell phone case and it doesn\\'t seem to work with a 5G Wi-Fi connection. it can take one to three minutes to connect to but initially it takes a longer time than using the app again to connect. they should make this app connect quicker to our appliances.Works ok, I had troubles getting things working to start with, heres a few tips. - Open google speach recognition and make sure you have a voice match profile saved and that all terms and conditions are accepted and up to date. - Use the LG account options not thirt party authentification services as they take time to create your account and send relevant emails, do it tjenold fassioned way. - Be patient, say \"Hey Google, ask LG\" if the responce is normal it worked if not it will twll you..Nice app but new LDT7808SS clothes washer stops communicating with WiFi. Holding WiFi btn for more than 3 secs usually restores connection but not always. Also Remote Start must be selected at washer before app can perform any actions, and selecting this option locks door so that no additional garments can be put in washer. Remote start resets after cycle has completed so must be selected again to enable app to perform any further actions. BTW both washer & my Android cell ph are on 2.4 GHz WiFi..Loved the app until last week when they did some kind of upgrade to it.  Now I cannot set up a schedule anymore as when i click Add schedule a box pops up saying Notice: please retry for normal operation. when i click on my pre-existing schedule the same box pops up but it changes my schedule forward by 1 hour..Your app consumes too much space for me only to use to diagnose my washing machine, you should have smaller size app for individual use.App just opens and then crashes. Bought a new LG washer today and installed this app on my Galaxy S7. Made it through setup and got to point where phone tries to pair with washer then it crashes. The App Crashed immediately on every open after that. Uninstalled app, reinstslled, cleared cache and app data. Looking at comments I can seen this app has been having issues for a while. This app is used with all of the newer LG appliances so I cant understand why LG would not put more effort in this.Just installed this app and it does not work for what I need. I wanted to customize one particular cycle and the app never gave me the ability to do that. It\\'s bad enough I really hate this washing machine and dryer system, but  to offer an app that is basically useless, is a sham..very useful. using it with dual cool ac. although sometimes it doesnt always connect to the appliance. you have to try several times. suggestion for improvement: a confirmation button when turning on the appliance would be mighty useful to avoid powering on by accidental tap..Useless permissions required. I do know where the fridge is, so why would this app need my location? Another question is why it wants to make phone calls. Who is it going to call? Verdict: data gatherer. Uninstall. Users should be allowed to enter needed info instead of being denied the entire app if LG cannot see their photos. Why was your choice to not allow manual config?.Works great to control my mini split wall unit. Though, requests could be a bit faster and some of the functions can\\'t be controlled from this app, such as turning off the light indicators. Overall, it\\'s a helpful app..forgets devices a lot, I\\'ve got two smart LG TVs one oldish, one new, it adds and controlled them individually really well, flawless to be fair, but it constantly forgets devices, i have to search, re-add, verify security handshake number between phone and tv, then next day either both or one of the tvs has vanished... shame, I\\'ve had to uninstall and go back to the good old clunky lg tv app..This app does so little that it\\'s not really worth downloading. Setup was problematic. If you already have a Google account registered, you can\\'t seem to share the dishwasher stairs unless you create a non-Google account and then share that out..Error code displayed during the wash cycle, but the washer will only send data to this app after the cycle is over.  At that point the app told me the load inside the washer was uneven, but since the cycle had already finished that information was completely useless.    App is hard to find on my phone because the app installs itself as SmartThinQ instead of LG SmartThinQ, so it doesn\\'t show up in a search for LG apps..Horrible app left to die. It\\'s inability to link with the Google Home app is just appaling. I\\'ve planned to create a smarthome ecosystem after buying a 4K LG TV with ThinQ AI, thinking i could use my Google Home speaker for voice activation. I also bought an LG Aircon with Wifi to connect to the ThinQ app for Google Home automation but now i can use voice command because LG devices refuse to show up in the Google Home app and the ThinQ app refusing to link. Utterly disappointed! Singapore region.I never write reviews, but to control my AC from work is such a nice feature. One issue I have is when switching to Energy Saver from Cool or vise versa, it changes the set temp to 60 degrees regardless what it was at so you have to fix it. Fix that one issue with the app and you have my 5 stars..works great didn\\'t think I would use this app but it is really handy to know where in the cycle machine is at and sends us notification when finished we put this app on both of our phones .our wt7300cw is so quiet we hardly know it\\'s running hopefully it will last a lot longer than our former get he toploader which sounded like a twin huey during spin cycle.LG SmartThinQ constantly crashes on my LG G7 ThinQ phone. After clearing data, cache, uninstalling, reinstalling, power cycle, with no third party security or battery saver apps, it crashes right after i approve permissions. Before I uninstalled the app, i was receiving notifications but tapping them would crash the app..I used to be able to use Tag On with my LG washing machine. Suddenly the Tag On doesn\\'t work the phone doesn\\'t pick up any signal from the washing machine. Tried two Android NFC phones and non work. Don\\'t know if machine has developed a fault or if the latest software update has affected my Tag On function. Not happy..ok, so some reviews say its awful. it wont switch on the tv but im happy about that because it wont have to be on standby. It was a fiddle to get it sorted but if i can do it at my age im sure younger people will find it a breeze. As long as you say \"Alexa, ask LG tv to ..... and give your command, Alexa will do it. cool..Application no longer alerts you when the washer or dryer has finished a load. Notifications stopped working around 5/18 all of a sudden. Edit 6/2 - reinstalling the app fixed the above issue. Now if i could just be allowed to start my dyer again after it completed a load remotely these would be perfect..After multiple false starts that turned out to be due to mistyped wi-fi password (an error that is revealed only on your next attempt to connect a device), my washer is now added to the app. It still showed as disconnected for a long while while I mashed the wi-fi button. Then it randomly decided to work. Seems okay if a little clunky, very few default options, have to download a cycle just to use the dryer..Great air conditioner but app is garbage. Doesn\\'t work. Doesn\\'t connect. It has a 3.8 rating for a reason. Annoyed because app control was a selling feature. Should have read the reviews first. That 3.8 would have been a big red flag. Thank God for the reliable 1990s technology remote..poor connectivity with device. too bad, the features look promising. Update: app is now more stable after update..bought new washer & dryer and love them, but if i get one more notice of server connection error and this app automatically closing everytime i open it, in less than 2 seconds and without me being able to read the notices or access information in the app in an \"offline\" mode then im going to pull my hair out. This is RIDICULOUS. Not worth the frustration of setting it up nor trying to use it. and yes I did get it setup after 3.5 hours and yes I am an IT guy who is knowledgeable of how it works..app keeps crashing after launch. it prompts \"failed to connect to server\" then the app crashes after i dismiss the notification..Why are my products tied to my device and not my account? That\\'s ridiculous!.Good aap and easy to use.The latest app does not even open. The app 3-4 updates before was working fine. This is with respect to my LG A/C which is wifi enabled..cant even get it to add my washer and dryer. It did make it past the searching screen twice(step 2) on the dryer only and got all the way to 100% complete and then said it didnt register. Very disappointed as I have all smart lights, thermostat etc, so obviously setup isnt beyond me but this is ridiculous. edit-able to add to work iphone but not my personal android.Don\\'t waste your time. Poor connections. Can\\'t create cyles for washer or dryer. Can only download the \"one\" cycle they have in the app. Too many permissions. App does not need access to location, phone calls, or any accounts..P to the O to the S. You have to log in to the ThinQ account. Then it wants to switch to an LG account where you have duplicate everything you did for the ThinQ account. Whereupon it sends you back without allowing you to register the product in an endless loop of uselessness. Thanks LG. Never get that 30 minutes back..UPDATE JULY 8 2019 SO THAT FIX DIDNT WORK . NOR can I control the machine remotely!!! They market there products to be smart. NOT SMART!! so LG just responded saying there is an option to turn bluetooth off in the settings of the app . NO THERE IS NOT THERE IS AN OPTION TO TURN OFF OR DISABLE WIFI AND BLUETOOTH NOT JUST BLUETOOTH IF I DISABLE WIFI THEN THE WASHER WILL NOT ALERT ME . GARBAGE APP AND IRRITATING RESPONSE FROM LG . Do you not know how your app functions why can you not fix this.This app is terrible I am unable to get it to connect to my internet or my air conditioner with the inverter just absolutely horrible experience. Hard to believe a company that\\'s large and was so much engineering can\\'t do a better job. I may return the product..No! I should not be forced to give location access to verify my wifi connection and definitely not access to making calls and call settings to verify my country and language preferences. Will be returning my air conditioner because I can\\'t use the advertised feature without accepting these ridiculous permissions..Well, I will guarantee that if nothing else in the app works the 40% of the home screen dedicated to ads will work. So 1 star is deserved for providing weather ads and ways to buy Amazon replenishment products. The less important part of the App is getting your personal information and sharing that with 3rd parties. The last part is if you care to get useful info from and control your appliance then LG collects everything but gives you crumbs. This app isn\\'t for you but for LG. Uninstall!.Extremely buggy. Washer keeps saying product registration failure after \\'succesfully\\' registering Refrigerator cant get past step 1 as after clicking Yes, it will prompt me to do LG Switching Account, which I tried and it tells me the account is registered with Google. So I just go back between these 2 actions to no end..I like the ability to see and control my appliances over the wifi but as long as you can only have one user on the app I can\\'t give it a good review. I buy $20 smart plugs that allow me to add multiple users on the app but LG can\\'t handle something that should be a basic feature..In my AC, I can\\'t create our modify any schedule operation after update. it says \"please retry for normal operation\"..remote start is a joke. why do i have to put it in Tempe start EVERY single time, that renders this feature useless..Love this app! So helpful.Excellent app to control the washer.I bought a 2018 LG TV and I can not link it up to the app and thusly can\\'t link it up to Google home. After researching, you can ONLY add a TV to the app if you live in USA! The rest of the world does exist and we are NOT happy. I\\'m just going to keep it simple and return the TV back to the shop. Where it really belongs.It let me know when the dishes were done and how long it will take. That\\'s good enough. No you cant hit a button and change the settings (via the app) after the dishwasher has started but who really needs to(control freaks). No it doesn\\'t load and unload the dishwasher for you but who really expects that(quit binge watching Netflix get up and do it yourself). overall I\\'m happy it lets me know when its done how its doing and how long it will take to be finished.Thanks LG.This app disconnects constantly from all devices. When attempting to reconnect, it takes me through the registration screen then blanks out. I\\'ve contacted LG support and followed all reconnection options including uninstall/reinstall. It\\'s temperamental frustrating and currently, completely pointless. Dont bother until you see some consistant positive reviews..Updated to new version last week and stopped getting notifications for both washer and dryer, even though notifications are turned on. I have to actually open the app to get the Push Notifications to pop up. The app also keeps turning on my Bluetooth without my permission..Sometimes I get notifications, other times I don\\'t. When checking time left, the app says my washer is off/not connected to the internet, but I hear the washer finish and the notification pops up. What gives? It can\\'t be off and on at the same time!.Hi LG, after updating the app, i could not able to join one of the Air-con wifi units to home router, the error shows \"network is full.\" The rest of thr Air-con units are okay. Is there a way to hard-reset network setting at Air-con via AC remote or hard button?.verry unintuitive washer options. 5 steps to get to what you want, plus what if I want to rince and spin only, but NOT at 1400rpm. Most options are not available to change.m. Also officially does not run on rooted devices. Not that anyone who has enough knowledge to root not know how to bypass that but why LG?.Nice to get notifications when the wash is done. But if the phone is in sleep mode for a while and the wifi turns off, then the notifications don\\'t seem to come through until you turn your phone bank on. Problematic.This is the worst app I have ever encountered. It not letting you signed in through any standard id say google or Facebook and when you try to sign up for then it not let you to select dob, and without that you can not sign up. So LG should have done atleast one round of QA before launching it. If the very first functionality is not working how can yiu release it for the use of customer. Very disappointing...Poor execution and poor integration with the hardware. Also there is no justification for not allowing the app to run without its privileges. Why on earth should you know where I am when I use the app. And no, the explanation in the app is not valid. The app does provide some basic extra features for our washing machine though..I am in utter disgust that the method chosen by the developers to determine system memory is through access to photos. Nobody in their right mind should find this acceptable. The instant I learned of this I cancelled my delivery of my new refrigerator and I uninstalled the app. Regardless of whether or not anyone has interest in my personal pictures,it is the principal of the matter.I see there are many other like minded people and I would think the devs would take the hint..no easy to use....needs a lot of update. didnt expect lg to launch an app which doesnt even work properly with the hardware(fridge).I accidentally chose the wrong region upon account creation and there\\'s no way to change it. Now google assistant won\\'t work with it..Before I can even open your app I HAVE TO allow permissions for sharing my location and allow your app to make and manage phone calls on my cel phone? Guess what, my reply is a loudly yelled no! My refrigerator foes not need to call anyone. I have a feeling that Google is behind this additional attempt to control one\\'s life. My next move will be to delete this app and call LG support for options..Requires log in information. Why would you need that to use a feature on the washer. wish I could use the feature, but I am not \\'logging on\\' to do so. I bought your product, you don\\'t need anything else from me. I may think twice about buying a product that requires a log in and more information about me and where I live and what I do..Decent washer dryer, terrible app on Android. Cycle download doesn\\'t work at all. Connectivity is unreliable so wash status isn\\'t updated. Energy usage function also doesn\\'t work at all. Hopefully updates pending to fix issues, otherwise not worth bothering with..claims that my smartphone isn\\'t \"NFC equipped\" so it wont even let us add our new washer and dryer as devices. Also, troubleshooting directions for using \"Smart diagnosis\" on our dishwasher (less than a year old) refers to buttons that don\\'t exist... considering this function was a big factor in our decision to buy these, it\\'s incredibly disappointing. The app wouldnt work with my old iPhone 6SE and now, doesnt work with our Huawei P30 or P20 lite..Love this App! I can monitor my appliances, start my machines and it alerts me if something is wrong. They also started this new service on some where they proactively let you know when you need to perform maintenance and stuff. It is so cool. Never thought my appliances could do this stuff..I bought a toc toc LG refrigerator and the manual says I could see the power consumption and how many times the doors were open and other stuff, but nothing of this was true, I can see only the temperature and change it, but either I can\\'t change to Celsius instead farenheit.I do not know what is happening with the services offered by LG with your app; I have tried to make use of it but it says that it is not possible to continue with the configuration process because there is no communication with the server ... they are already two days old and I still have the problem..very interesting way to diagnose problems with this household appliance. When we can literally communicate with the devices in our home and control things remotely... it really shows the advancement of our species. As far as the functionality of the refrigerator and its diagnostic system, it worked rather well. I\\'m pleased with the scope of the capabilities of this usually mundane home fixture. very cool..this app is useless. unable to control washer remotely. You actually have to power on the washer or dryer and then push the remote activation on the apliance before you can use \"remote start\". what a total waste of money. Tech support is also useless. They are unable to communicate effectively or to resolve issues relating to the the app..Very bad! The app doesn\\'t connect to the dehumidifier - MD19GQGA1. Tried multiple times with different phones and login. Even have the retailer to do a home visit to fix it. The app is just not cutting it. The dehumidifier is connected to wifi (2.4Ghz as recommended on LG instruction manual) but app kept repeating that the registration failed. Even more ridiculous is the recommendation to set the dehumidifier next to the router (which we did by the way), how weak can the receptivity be?!.There\\'s no reason that this app needs location and phone access to do it\\'s job. 1 star for being deceptive about the permissions requirements..Pushes advertising. Why buy an appliance that sends you advertising?.Always says failed to connect to server even though I have good internet connection ??.The September 11 update has broken the app. LW1017ERSM Air Conditioner always shows OFF in the app and turning it on sets the unit to 60 degrees on Cool mode. Energy Saver mode isn\\'t accessible because once you select at and change the temperature it goes break to Cool mode..OK app, but very annoying with the same pop-up message every week or so about oven spills being easier to clean up while they are fresh. If you are going to annoy me with messages, at least provide some variety..Why does this app require location, phone, and photos just to start? There is zero justification for this. My mini split ac was borderline on ok and with the demands of this app, my feelings about it are now negative. I wouldn\\'t buy another invasive LG product ever again..The notification telling you it\\'s done seems like the only useful feature after 3 days of use. comes in handy as we cant hear the washer and dryer in our hom because it\\'s so quiet. overall pretty cool seems to need a little work still to function smooth..Brand new 49SK8100PLA TV, followers the instructions for setup, now what? You\\'re instructions state \"after completing registration your TV will NOT be listed in the SmartThinQ app\" so what\\'s the point? So doesn\\'t show connected TV so the app does nothing!.Too many permissions! I installed, read the privacy policy and promptly uninstalled before setting up an account. The very small amount of convenience the app might provide nowhere nears the amount of privacy you are giving up, no matter what the LG Company wonk who replies in these reviews says..I have 2 Lg heat pumps at a remote location. I control 1 heat pump with this app and the other 1 with Sensibo app the Sensibo is much more superior then then Lg its quicker and never times out and tells exact tempture and humidity instead of saying low temp. and is more user friendly and cheaper then the Lg(hard to find) module you need to buy for the Lg app..app constantly has issues connecting to ac and refrigerator despite being three feet from the router. connectivity with google assistant is horrid and needs to be reset once a day. a disgusting effort that makes me want to return my quite refrigerator and guarantees I wont by the smart stove I was going to purchase..I like the custom downloadable cycles and the ability to know it is done on my phone, but remember to turn on the remote start each time I power on the washer or dryer is frustrating. Make it remember the setting or connect automatically and this app would have 5 stars from me..love this! I love that it let\\'s me know when to clean the tub and when the cycle is done..Unable to login into my LG account. The app might work brilliantly but as I can\\'t login I can\\'t find out..per my owners manual my model has wifi capability. when I download the app, it only tells me it can do diagnostics of the dishwasher. what a waste of my time. I was convinced when buying this model I could download cycles to the machine. there are options for that ok n my app. I am very disappointed..this is my rating 0. too intrusive. you ask to have access to almost every function in the phone, and you need very little. you have to restrict yourself to only those services in the phone that are needed to communicate with the appliances.. So I am removing this app..Piece of junk app. it won\\'t find any of my wall mount AC units after router reboot. I have to delete my 3 wall mount units, shut the main breaker off my HVAC unit just so it can find and see them again to re-add to the network! Horrible app!.The app is a little weird at first but its works well enough. Washer and dryer Wi-Fi connected in under 10 minutes. LG should work closely with more home automation systems.. I had to reset my Alexa devices to get the LG Alexa skill to work...It works-ish with my air-conditioning , but not particularly well. Getting product status is very slow. The sub screen that shows target temp and unit status never shows anything, and the settings below that are not finished. It does integrate with Alexa reasonably..tl;dr - LG has managed to develop an IoT platform that lacks everything that makes the Internet of Things powerful.  If you\\'re considering an internet-enabled appliance, I would recommend NOT going with LG\\'s SmartThinq platform.   This app is as basic as it gets. Shows my washer and dryer, and ony updates the status after having the app screen open for at least 30 seconds (I know this because the status doesn\\'t update until after the screen has dimmed). Push notifications often fail to show up (yes, I\\'ve disabled battery management and other Android issues that can block notifications), and even when they do show up, there\\'s no action that can be triggered by them.  The ONLY use for this app is to ask Google how much time is left on my laundry. Flash your smart-home\\'s lights when it\\'s done? Not possible. Integrate with IFTTT? Only if you\\'re in the United States (and even then, I can\\'t speak to its utility, since I\\'m not).  There is no support for third-party integrations (e.g. API access for non-partners), this app is nearly useless, and the incredible power of the internet to connect things and make them talk to one another is actively ignored by LG..Include English language in all countries. Translation is very poor, mixed with English (sometimes 3 languages are mixed, depending what country/language you choose). Also, limiting account that account can be registered only in one country is not OK. Why?.Good Product App , but should be Optimized for fast access of app with product. As the App has a bit slow/laggy access , even on a High Speed Wifi (100Mbps) connection. But overall its very useful with all LG wifi products controlled and monitored in single app from anywhere. Thanks to LG..Not fully customisable. Tried it for my LG washing machine. Wanted only spin cycle, nothing else but could only select pre-determined cycles. All I wanted was a 1400 RPM spin, no previous rinse etc. There are a number of suggested cycles one can download but none further customisable..Fun & easy to use. Just wish I had an app to load my washing machine & do the detergent. Lmao. Thanks LG.... Dont hope to have to use smart diagnosis anytime soon. But I have checked the machine & the door was open & that was the diagnosis the app gave me. Great App! Please let customers know that this is the app to use & not LG Smart Laundry & DW global app..Size is too big and not work with google assistant Says not available in Bangladesh.I just bought the WT7200C LG washing machine and wow, what a nightmare! I have literally tried for 5 hours to wash just 10 t-shirts on normal wash and keep getting an LE error. Too heavy of a load. I tried for 5 hours straight. I am returning this piece of junk first thing in the morning and will never buy anything LG again. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!.Requires too many permissions that are not necessary to the functioning of the app. The app doesn\\'t respect my desire to disable location and phone permissions and still let me use it. Why do you need phone permission to get my default language and county? If it\\'s off then ask me for them. Same goes for location. I\\'m already providing WiFi credentials which should be good enough. Why do you need to be able to track my location the entire time i have the app installed? It makes it unusable..just waiting to end the current cycle for starting another dry cycle so when arriving home all done. Not possible. Remote Start turns itself Off at the end of a cycle in no time. Remote Start fake function. Dry cycles not recognized, not even remaining time..I have tried at least a dozen times in the month since buying my refrigerator just to connect the app, and it gets stuck on \"connecting with the product\" at 40% EVERY time. My Note8 phone meets all requirements. Very frustrated..Paid a premium on the washer dryer combo and extra for the thinq, don\\'t know why this app will not show energy consumption after each cycle. Keeps saying no recent history. 2 stars until it\\'s fixed as I\\'m assuming it\\'s a global issue. , edit : 28/07/19 , its working well after all these months. re-reviewed !.I find much convenient.Just purchased a brand new washer/dryer combo. NFC registration doesn\\'t work on either machine. I have a phone with NFC (GALAXY S7). Audible chime from the machine when touching my phone to tag on area but nothing happens. Fake feature..Location and phone access should not be required to use this app. If a user denies access to those functions, the rest of the app should still work. This is an indication of poor app design at best, or data harvesting at worst..I\\'ve just used my app for the first time and really enjoyed it. Only thing that could make it better is to allow access to change some of the settings. my favorite is the text I get when my washer load is complete..This latest update has been draining a lot if battery behind the scenes. Something is running in the background without my permission and knowledge so i had to disable it - now my phone is back to normal battery life. Poor job by LG. Does not deserve any stars!.It would be an awesome feature if you add an option to control multiple devices simultaneously with the same command, this is specially advantageous with multiple ac units in an apartment, so you can set a certain temperature for them all at once with just one command..Uninstalled immediately because why would my washing machine need access to my microphone, my camera, my address book, my phone logs? Pure spyware. This LG washer was a serious mistake because it never uses enough water to even cover the clothes. If they have location then why would they need phone access to know my country? In fact, why do they need location to know where I am? All they need is to know is if my washing machine is connected to WiFi. I don\\'t believe at all what they said..Terrible. My *terrible* LG fishwasher is broken... again. And this app wants location permission, permission to make phone calls, and access to my contacts list just so it can tell me what a two digit error code means. Sorry, not letting you track everything I do and everyone I know in perpetuity just so I can eat off of a clean plate. Pound sand, LG.after developer reply: thanks I am aware of the functionality but reviewed it in the hope you expand functionality slow app , limited functionality, it turns off few seconds after cycle is completed disconnecting the appliance from the app completely so won\\'t be able check status anymore.When I initially connected the app to my washer and dryer, the connection process worked fine. After about a year of it working, I changed my home wifi system and now only the dryer will connect. Uninstalling and reinstalling the app does nothing..Pretty useless app if the appliance gets disconnected. Have to enable Remote connect every time you power the appliance. Takes less time to select a cycle and walk away. Then to check back later and find the wireless disconnect so you cant receive updates..clogged whole house filter caused the washer to stop and throw an error code. Instead of having to search the internet for answers, LG SmartThinQ did it for me. Even though i pretty much over what the problem was, if i hasn\\'t, the app makes it easy to solve problems with the Smart Diagnosis feature..This app is the next coolest thing . So awesome . Just love it!!!.I hate app always request enable Bluetooth..The app is a good idea, but is not easy to use. You have to be at the machines to turn them on anyway. The preloaded cycles are very generic and hard to customize. There is not a \"create your own\" cycle..so far, a few days in, this seems like a really nice, while straightforward, smart app device. were using it for a window ac unit. im excited to see how to make the household more efficient this summer..It\\'s ok. My pair isn\\'t wi-fi. They\\'re just \"smart diagnosis\" capable, so it\\'s a bit misleading. That said, mine are brand new so I haven\\'t needed a diagnosis, but if either messes up, it\\'ll be interesting to see if this aids in fixing an issue..it would be good if it shows the present temperature inside the fridge...the temperature control works fine.but the inside present temperature is not indicated anywhere..thats a disappointment...my samsung refrigerator used to display the inside present temperature...Push notifications don\\'t work for a washing machine even though everything is connected properly.  I can see the time remaining, the current cycle and so on but no notification is sent when the washing machine finishes the cycle..Crappy update, it was working fine but this latest update starts the Bluetooth without asking and for a reason yet to be known. It also keeps throwing a \"network inestability\" error and shutting down the app... completely useless as of now..Not possible to share a device with another user..Took awhile to connect but all good.thanks..Very cool app. Did think I needed an apl for my refrigerator but started having issues with slow ice. come to find out, it was too much water in the system. drained water and it is working again. very cool tech..It only tells you when my wash is done. I have to turn in this list remote start every time in the washer to have it work. When my wash is done, it would be useful to turn it on again especially if I\\'m not gonna be back for a few hours.Forced to use this app to download custom programmes to my washer dryer but the ingenious developers haven\\'t included the basic info of the different programmes available, e.g the temperature of the downloaded programme+the app doesn\\'t work quite often, really disappointed in LG, won\\'t buy any of their products in the future..Pretty good start. Getting better. App should know what filters I use and at least have a link to purchase them. I also get an email when I need filters and that does tell me what filters they are. Otherwise a pretty solid app..Unfortunatelly I can\\'t connect to the Google Assistant, because it\\'s not allowed in Hungary. I don\\'t understand, because it\\'s can connect with other smart home apps, so I believe something wrong with the SmartThinq app. Please fix it, thanks.my air conditioner is S3-Q18KL1DC. 70% energy saving model. but in your app there is no Energy Ctrl. button option? Mode button options are limited in app. room temperature value is different compare with remote control.?? give us a quick update again....Keeps me on my toes about what my going wrong. It\\'s nice to be proactive with appliances ??????.I have a brand new refrigerator and I keep getting \"The registration process failed while communicating with our system\".  Would you like to try again? I tried again multiple times.  Still doesn\\'t work.  I wish LG would fix this..I can get it to work fine with my washing machine but disappointed the additional downloads are just the same washing programmes that are preloaded in the machine. A good idea but could be much better with more choice of washes..App used to work fine with all the options to adjust temperature setitngs etc for my AC portable unit. now you can only turn it on and off. can\\'t adjust anything. worked fine first 6 months. why update an app that waa working fine? I own a NOTE9 so I know its not my phone..The app was working and then just stopped working! I don\\'t receive any notifications anymore when the washing machine finished it\\'s cycle and there\\'s  no device usage history or energy monitoring information available anymore. Can this problem be resolved?.This is one useless App. Bought a brand new refrigerator which has the SmartThinq function and was unable to register the appliance. Fails to register after reaching 90%.   LG you need rethink how to do the IOT device registrations properly..Cannot connect to Google Home in Sri Lanka. It says your country is not supported. If the product is sold I Sri Lanka how come it\\'s not supported for this feature. Bought the AC due to Wifi feature if it does not fully support purpose lost..App is simple to use but menu items are not self explanatory. Especially the ice functionality is not clear. In-app help or link to YouTube video explaining the product function and app usage could help the user a lot..Makes our washing and cleaning of various type of fabrics easier and economical though the apps report on energy consumption did not indicate the unit and value of energy usage. Kindly fix and update the apps for more useful data tracking of energy consumption..I bought this product specifically for the WIFI option. Now it doesn\\'t even connect anyone and says I have to use the LG wifi connection??!! How can I use something I don\\'t even have the password for since it\\'s not my wifi domain name??!!!! VERY VERY disappointed in this product.would be great but I\\'m unable to connect my dryer to this app any assistance would be greatly appreciated...Works perfectly with my Washer and the refrigerator.Works excellent, very handy!.App works as intended. Good job Devs.I do like the convenience, but remote operation seems to be limited to rather basic functions. Haven\\'t downloaded any cycles yet, so I\\'m hoping that will add more control..Setting it up was easy, but it takes a bit of time to display wash information. Will wait for a few days and see. Update: though not very user-friendly, it helps in coming up with a wash cycle of it own..I only use the app to control and monitor our A/C unit. I am able to turn it on and off, and create a schedule for its operation, all through the app while we\\'re away. I can also see our unit\\'s energy consumption..Bought a new fridge.. WiFi connected well and all.. only problem I have is.. on my phone it says 4 farenheit.. on the fridge it shows 4degree celcius.. I\\'m sure a simple update can fix this issue.. there\\'s no farenheit to Celsius setting in the app.. include that please.It turns on the bluetooth of my phone for no reason. Whenevet I start this app it first turns on the bluetooth. what does it need bluetooth for? Thanks for your response. But still can you please why it needs to turn the bluetooth on at first place..unable to launch the application. restriction no rooted phones. please remove the restriction asap! thanks (update: even banks allowing to run application on rooted smart phones so now allowing to use the app should be decission of the customer and not the vendor!). Not happy!.Can\\'t access 5G networks? Can\\'t use special characters in a network name? So I\\'m supposed to rename my network and change all the 20 other appliances in my house that can and already do connect to my network with a period in the name?.can\\'t do much with it. you can just download cycles that you can set yourself anyway without the long process of tag on. if I could control the appliance remotely, that would be useful..why cant I register washing machine with nfc, only wifi products. I wish companies would stand by there products instead of taking features away once you\\'ve had them for a while... I know this when I put the the phone with nfc enabled to the machine the makes a noise but the does nothing..app doesn\\'t recognize it..Waste of time. The google assistant integration is woeful and forces you to go through lg thinkq\\'s own ai which cant even turn the tv on! And when it does work, be prepared to wait 30 seconds for a channel change..Everything is great about the app although I never did get the smart diagnosis to work where you hold your phone close to the logo. I eventually did get it to work through the Wi-Fi though.Handy for controlling my air conditioner but it is so slow. After opening the app it takes 30 sec before I can click on the air conditioner. It\\'s way faster to get off my butt and walk to the AC!.Utterly terrible. My F4J8FH2W claims to be WiFi enabled, but the instructuons in the manual are SO poor, and the device registration wizard in the app describe buttons and options that dont exist. I was litterally shouting with frustration trying to use this..very helpful although the ability to make a fully customized wash dry cycle would be nice, feels like theres alot of menus to go through. and a written preview of what each wash does settings wise would be nice incase one selects a wash that isnt compatible with certain garments.can\\'t even open app. it keeps on saying server failed yo connect..The slowest app I met in smart home category. It takes around minute to connect to device using this app.Hard to connect appliances.Constantly have to reinstall because it can\\'t connect to my TV..Love it. Don\\'t have to keep time..Won\\'t complete registration and contradicts itself on status. Says devices are registered and then throws an error saying devices couldn\\'t register. Endless loop of trying to set up devices that I can see on my account online..You\\'ll never actually use this app unless you live in an LG branded smart home, and even then you\\'ll probably never touch this app. Even if you do, it would take less time to replace every appliance you own than it would for this app to finish loading..I have 2 Lg appliances that are smart. one with the NFC tag, and my dishwasher has wifi. followed the instructions in the manual. but neither one will connect. lg offers no support, and it seems almost all comments online say they can\\'t connect also..I read the poor reviews while downloading the app and immediately deleted it. Apparently the app is as half cocked as the stupid \"smart\" washer that won\\'t let me wash my clothes as I see fit. Why do I need a remote start anyway when I don\\'t have an ai to load my washer for me. I might as well hit the start button while I\\'m there....The app is super buggy as well as it lags like hell. Smart diagonosis for AC does not work most of the time. A multinational compnay LG cannot construct a app is really unbelievable. Thats why they never got succes in android mobile phone..Can\\'t get past wifi setup.Hello LG team, I purchased 9kg washing machine it is in-built Wi-Fi function for connecting mobile for operating system but my mobile is not connecting to the machine due non availability of the NFC, So LG team, it is possible to connect all types of mobiles whitout NFC Function, Please update soon. Thanks.Not much use for this app. To boot it no longer communicates with my washer and dryer. When I first got them in February I could use the diagnostics and program cycles. Now it does nothing with Android 9..Not able to link this account with Google Home. Kept getting error message, \"Couldn\\'t update the setting. Check your internet connection\". It\\'s a smooth integration with Samsung SmartThings and DLink..Wish the app was capable of detecting the fridge being in demo mode. My fridge (floor model) was in demo mode and the app did not detect or mention that the unit is in demo mode. The app needs more work in my opinion..Hopeless... Trying to hook up my TV to Alexa, after registering on this app it says my TV won\\'t be on the dashboard... DUH! If its not on the dashboard how in gods name am I meant to select it!!!!!!!!!.so far this works great. love how it sends you a notification when the washer and/ or dryer is done and shows how much time is remaining. my washer and dryer is in the garage.Doesn\\'t work with android phone with latest OS for their laundry system with the \"tag on\". went through all the troubleshooting options. This app WILL work flawlessly with my wife\\'s LG phone.... Just not with my android phone.This may be the worst app that I\\'ve used in my smart home journey. It\\'s super disappointing, and I may have purchased a different washer and dryer set entirely had I known how terrible the process would be. LG makes phones, but can\\'t make a sensible wifi connection process?.app is very intuitive and easy to use. connection instructions were a bit vague but once that was done all good. probably the only issue is you cannot turn the machines on remotely.this app won\\'t link to Google home, I can\\'t get pass the sign in page (using the Google account).Love the instant updates..Can\\'t turn on appliances from off state.Seems to work well. No complaints..This app cannot trigger Google Assistant (GA) to inform the house when a wash is done. GA can, however, start a wash if it is set up for a remove start. IFTTT doesn\\'t see the washer at all. Rediculous..It won\\'t connect via wifi. I tried for a few hours and used the customer support, but they were no help. I guess I really don\\'t need to monitor anything on it... So much for it being a smart appliance....It took some time to figure out how to actually get the app to communicate with the refrigerator, but got a lot of useful statistical data to help me reduce thw annual cost associated with the operation of my smartfridge!.The apps doesn\\'t work properly after updated it this morning. Unable to use the apps to control the washer/connection. I had tried to logout and re-login, still the same. Please advise. Thanks..app worked well, but recent update added location and call permissions, contacts etc... since I won\\'t allow this, it\\'s become worthless... there would have to be very compelling reasons for me to allow these new requirements... too invasive, removing app..Update broke this app. It used to work perfectly. Update uninstalled washer and dryer, and now won\\'t sync both on the same account. I am not gping to create two accounts. This app update sucks!!!! oh yeah, this is on an LG G6 android phone.Why does this app need permission to make phone calls, Yeah right I don\\'t think so. And our brand new washing machine is already having problems and it\\'s only 5 weeks old, last LG product I\\'ll be looking at!.Will not run on Sony Xperia XZ1 w Oreo - Says phone is root:ed Will not run on Sony Z3 Compact tablet - Not compatible Will run on a very old Samsung phone though  Need permissions that makes no sense - if you do not grant all permissions the app wont even try to start..No TV support. The link provided in the response also does not help. The \"Set Up TV for the Google Assistant\" option is not available on the TV and LG refuses to connect my TV to Google Assistant due to lack of support in my country..I wanted to use the NFC based smart functionality of my washer. The price to pay: LG account or Google/Facebook sign in, location, call, and media access for the 70+ MB monster of an app. Not worth it. Immediate uninstall..Love the app but the latest update crashes on my Android--starts to open but then crashes and shuts down so I have to give it a zero rating at this point.  The earlier versions all worked fine..little bit awkward. cant set orogram remote - nothing. all it does it turn appliance on/off, give status on how long remaining and start diagnosis in case of machine errors. expected more..requires permission to make calls, unacceptable for info about my country is not really needed, moreovere, it can be determined without reading my SIM if needed. requires logon to cloud for simple control of local devices. multiple usage of prefabricated responses shows lack of interest on the side of LG..I can\\'t get my wi-fi to work on my fridge, i dont understand why it has to be so complicated for no reason, i press and hold the wi-fi button for 3 seconds, and nothing happens on my app, the wi-fi icon is just blinking on the fridge.Its stupid that we not only have to surrender location and phone access but ALSO need to create an account just to diagnose our appliances..Doesn\\'t work on a rooted device. I wonder why :).i use this couple time, and this must have contain a lot of capabilities, because it has over 180MB of data. i use this only for my washing machine, hard to connect..was working well at the start notifications came as they should but lately they seem to be a few hours late. I did get a notification about an update I\\'m sure that will fix this issue..Showing the content of downloadable wash program would be a more than welcome addition. Having to download the program to the machine to know how it\\'s configured is really annoying. Please change that..Would not recognize my LG account ID and password. Then I tried logging in using Google it popped out and asked me to log in with Google. Trying to interact with my LG range/oven but this app different work for me yet..I use this app at least 2 times a month to reset my LG Refrigerator/Freezer. If you leave the doors open to long, the ice maker stops making ice until you reset it with the app..Overlying complicated to connect my washer and dryer to my wifi and to the app. The app provides hardly any useful features..only nice thing is that it will send you a push message when your wash or dryer cycle is done..The app looks like a good idea but in my case using it with the washer and dryer the app doesn\\'t let my change options. I can just choose the Cycle but I can\\'t modified any of the settings (temperature, soil level, spin, etc).Horrible software and development team. What were they thinking when they tried to integrate everything into a single app? Instead of adding functions they removed most of it I actually used rendering my \"smart appliances\" dumb.Great app but I just want to spin and nothing else, can\\'t find this function..LG, or current users, can someone please tell me the default WIFI PW when setting up A/C window unit? it was deleted in error. I tried the last 4 characters of name but no go...Update, it has been weeks and no reply..used to work great until latest update. I cant connect to the device after the latest update. and it always turn on bluetooth automatically. These days the app sucks, couldn\\'t even open the app..Big app. Requires permissions to be granted or else it will not start, nothing graceful about that. A bit of hassle to go through just to use a gimmick on my washing machine..Great app! Really love it, works perfectly with my dishwasher, range, fridge and a microwave. Also have Samsung\\'s washer and a dryer and their app is simply horrendous. Great job LG!.It was hard to connect the washer with the app. However, now it works great. I would just advise you to take your time connecting your appliance with the app..LG washer, I seem to only have the option to turn it off when it\\'s finished it\\'s cycle, I can\\'t seem to start another cycle immediately. if I have it on a wash and dry cycle, but I know everything won\\'t be dry, I can\\'t start another dry cycle. only turn off the machine.great app. let\\'s you know when laundry is finished. or you can preload and start remotely. if AC is off, you can turn it on, when you\\'re on your way home from work, so upon your arrival it\\'s nice and cool. good job LG.Functionality needs to improve.The app requires too many intrusive permissions. Why does it need access to make calls, or to my location and personal information? I wanted to see how it would work with LG products that I was interested in buying, however I didn\\'t make it past the login screen, as didn\\'t want to sign up..Seems to take forever to update when you check to see what cycle it\\'s on. Also you can\\'t use the app if you haven\\'t physically turned on the dishwasher first which seems a bit silly..Buggy and most features are almost useless for washer and dryers. Only useful for notification of completed cycle and for tracking # of times apliance used per month. Would be awsome if it just had remote restart dryer steam refresh and multi-user/multi-phone/multi-login support..This app is awesome. i can control my fridge and washer with it and it works perfectly. Connectiom could be faster but i can\\'t complain right now..It would be more interactive if you give more control on all washing cycle parametrers to make our choice for customized washing cycle..LG should provide us all control right from Wash Spin Temperature and Speed..Its basic now..Give us pro version of this app...I like the new LG laundry pair, but for a company that makes tech products this is the worst IoT connected app I\\'ve used to date. The washer will not stay connected, and after many complaints about the same issue, no update from LG. Disappointing..garbage app. can\\'t even log in to begin using this app. Help references say to uninstall and reinstall. did that three times. same \"failure to connect to server\" message. not worth the frustration..the app is okay, the washing machine is awful, no spin only cycle, the display isnt standard 7-segment, its some strange 12-segment display ams i often have no idea what number it\\'s trying to display..Quite useful but very very slow! It takes almost 30 seconds to see the status of a connected device, and in some instances, it times out. Quite unreliable if you ask me..Makes life easy, you can easily find out error just by using simple app.Nice to have remote start and monitoring, but I can\\'t use the customizing options through remote start that I can directly on my washer and dryer. You can\\'t monitor status unless you use remote start..More trouble than its worth. Deleted after the first use when it was apparent that it wouldn\\'t let me make specific settings that I could make from the washer\\'s control panel. Worthless!.Great first version, and performs the essentials nicely. The user interface could use some small amount of improvement, but overall a great priduct..There\\'s no TV option even though all the tutorials online say to add the TV through the app to control it through Alexa. The customer service team I called 3 times didn\\'t even know what an Alexa was..i love this convenient way to diagnose issues with my new 3 month old refrigerator. great technology. just wish i didn\\'t have to use it 3 months after purchasing a LG french door refrigerator after paying so much for it ??.As others. After latest update I am no longer receiving a notification after end of cycle. Worked fine before. You can open app and still see washer, time remaining etc. Please fix! Thank you.Too many permissions and slow. Location information is unnecessary for functionality, but it is forced on you and you must always grant it at each login if you remove it between uses.The app is badly broken. I can\\'t add the LG smart TV. The list of applicances ends at the bottom with a weird item that shows a blank. You guys seriously need to pay for better software developers..Why does app force Bluetooth to turn on? I dont recall previous version doing that. Also, after upgrading, the app no longer recognized my washer and I had to re-register it for the app to recognize it..Seems useful but I should be able to create a custom setting I can adjust any setting at all on any wash cycle. It\\'s a fantastic idea but this is where Samsung are better..When logging in the first time, got the error: \"Attention: Invalid request headers\". Even after clearing app data, I still can\\'t get it to let me log in..it is just for a notification not for to do anything manually in app.. it means if we want only to make our clothes dry then we cant... we need some more options in app like soak,wash,rinse,spin.. make a individual setting for different operating....The application is nice for checking you wash and I would assume your dryer. it\\'s not something I really think about I normally just approximate the time and head down to the laundry room around the right time to take care of things..Can\\'t add my dryer. Click on dryer, then Yes for Smarthunq logo, Yes for touchscreen, then I get a pop-up for some LG Account Switcher thing. The app never let\\'s me add my dryer. Washer was added just fine.The app is updated constantly. Every update dumps our air conditioner. The app is junk. LG should learn how to program before they advertise a whole home wireless experience..Although I can control my TV\\'s volume thru this app and to turn the tv off, I cannot launch Youtube, Netflix, or any other app thru Voice (Google Assistant). Can anyone help me with this issue?.works great with my LG equipment and lets me track power usage and other helpful info.Editing schedules is a joke. Buggy, always crashing..FAILED TO CONNECT TO SERVER! No other options. I knew I should\\'ve bought Samsung Appliances. LG Total Fail..Cannot get it to download. Just keeps saying install, and I install and then says install again. Have tried many things with my phone it isn\\'t helping..Commercial Spyware, it won\\'t install on a tablet as it wants access to a phone to dial and the phones (not washer) location?! Very odd for a supposed WiFi/BT app, have LG taken up customer personal information hoarding?.The app will not even open. simply crashes at start up. And yes, i uninstalled and reinstalled. no use waste of telling wifi appliances cant even use in emergencies. if i can post images in reviews would have posted the frequent crash msg by the app..Constantly struggles to work properly. Notifications work then don\\'t work for long periods of time. Connecting devices is an ordeal..its great that there is an app with which we can control appilances, but can be only beneficial when its interface is fast and responsive.I request lg team to improvize the app in terms of its speed and responsiveness.I Dont Know How to Connect . I try many times to Connect my machine with phn but not get sucess . The Service engineer come to give demo they also dont give demo for that Feature nd Now I have another issue regarding the automatic machine it just sliped nd Change the direction while spinning ..*Update: All good now since this latest update, thank you* Since the last update I do not get notifications when the washer is done. It used to work perfectly. And the Push Notifications setting is on..Excellent App offering great device control of all LG devices and appliances. I use the app for both audiovisual devices and kitchen appliances, and allows for easy configuration..App is good with features. However reason I gave 2 stars are :- 1. This app is super slow. 2. Most of the time there server is not working. LG you need to work really hard. Thank you..Dear LG thank you for your great service! I have some problems with app, how can I edit process of mode from my smartphone, like doing it without smartphone? Another problem is, I can not see here My program. It would be grateful, if we can use them these two solutions.Is this a 2019 \"smart\" app?. I will tell you as user what\\'s wrong. BTW I\\'m talking about a washer-dryer. 1-I have to do it all, that\\'s not smart. First there\\'s a wifi AND a remote start button. What for would I want to connect it to wifi if not for controlling it? 2- ONE preferred wash program available to download. I want them all. 3-Your app doesn\\'t allow me to select a program and then modify parameters. They\\'re not perfect. 4-It doesn\\'t show you info about what it\\'ll do to my clothes..In of world of privacy violations and data breaches, why would an app that talks to my washer and dryer need my location and the ability to make phone calls..Doesn\\'t show how much time left nor it gives us to access the product through it.Pop up tells me \"can not run on a rooted device.\" Have Galaxy S6 and it is not rooted, so I\\'m not sure what the issue is..WHY does this app refuse to run if my phone is rooted? what possible reason should you be blocking me running this on a rooted phone. so what if i dont want ads on my phone and want to control my AC from the internet?.It simply just tells you mostly the machine status more than controlling the machine. Yet, when the machine finishes it job, you can do nothing about that at all!.Literally everything is connected to google home and alexa. Not this LG AC i have bought. It doesnt even work with my phone\\'s IR remote either. Please do include smart thinq service to Google home, Alexa and IFTTT..I have to walk up to the machine to tell it to give me remote access every time! what the hell do I need remote access for if I have to walk up to the machine every time?! This app is useless.I could connect and register my dishwasher right away, but can\\'t get past 90% registration on my new frig. Tried about a dozen times doing everything that was suggested. I\\'m using a Samsung S7..Uninstalling. You\\'d think LG would take the hint by now with everyone refusing to enter unnecessary personal info or allow invasive permissions? I call BS on LG\\'s reasons. Why does this need to turn on my phone\\'s Bluetooth when the A/C uses WiFi? The UI is kludgy and slow. The only thing useful in the app is being able to schedule when the A/C turns on/off. It\\'s obvious that LG isn\\'t interested in investing in its own app development, how embarrassing!.It\\'s really helpful & performance is outstanding. I was tensed about my refrigerator, it was gragling for long time & the sound was painful. Finally got the solution. ?????.this app is amazing I love that I can do diagnostic tests to my appliances at any time and it also gives me possible solutions and how to fix and a chance to contact customer support I need help with anything keep up the good work LG.The latest update sucks. I cannot even see the real-time power consumption of my AC unlike the previous version. I also get the error \"Service check restricts app usage...\".disconnects constantly. I have a smart AC and when I try to set a schedule for it to go on and off automatically the app randomly changes the times I set. This app is next to worthless for me..Cant hook up refrigerator Tryed for over an hour. Cant find the refrigerator. Worthless app!!!!!.Garbage app. Every LG appliance I attempt to connect via WiFi says \"registration failed\".Why doesn\\'t it open on a rooted device?.This is great, it will inform you about what you need to do to keep your washer running. It told me what to when my washer was unbalanced. It will remind you to do maintenance on your washer..It angers me to no end when apps require birthdates for no reason. Why the dyer manufacturer need a birthday to operate a dryer. I\\'ve uninstalled the app & will turn it on with traditional method. Pushing the on switch when the we clothes go in..will not do anything but open to a blank screen and do nothing. Installed on Lg V30 thinQ. Reinstalled 2 times to tey to get it to work.. App is broken.. if it even worked to start with..This app requires permissions it should not. You\\'re not a telephone, you don\\'t get phone permission. I can set my language by hand, thank you. You\\'re not a map, you don\\'t get location permission either. There\\'s no excuse for this behaviour..Not working at all, can\\'t create account by either Facebook or Lg account. Keeps saying data doesn\\'t comply with their policies. Requires unnecessary permissions (location) and date of birth..Doesn\\'t work, despite that the washer is playing the sound codes, the application tells that can\\'t identity the problem. Very frustrating after many tries..first time user of the tech, the appliances are downstairs and it is so nice not having to get up and go downstairs to check and see if they are done, plus being able to start and stop the appliances from away from home is super cool.Says \"Cannot run on rooted device\" when I try and open it. I do NOT have a rooted device. I have a brand new Pixel 3. Been on hold with LG customer service for 1.5 hours.There is no apparent way to use the application without creating an account, which is an unforgivable regression compared to earlier versions of the application..its hard to install and follow the steps. uff if you are not connect to wifi is not working but if you are its not working. you have to restart and restart the application uff anyway I use it my washer manually..Seems to have stopped working with my mini split since the last update (Always shows it as disconnected). Not very useful even when it is working though. What good is a schedule if I can\\'t even set temperatures?.Frustrating to set up!! However I still recieved notification when laundry is complete, even when not at home. I do like the download cycle, wish, they had an athletic clothing selection for it..The app doesn\\'t notify me when the washer finishes. i also wish the app would tell me at a glance whether there is a load waiting to come out of either washer or dryer. I\\'m not the only one doing laundry..will not work if you don\\'t give permission to access location and \\'make and manage\\' phone calls. seeing that i just want this for my smart tv, i don\\'t see why they need this permission to function..Total garbage. Gets in the way of Google Assistant...and doesn\\'t have native support for Pandora. Needs Chromecast to work... But LG does not build that into their TVs like Vizio does..works good when it works. Remote start only works if you \"plan ahead\". Push notifications randomly stopped working. Uninstalled then reinstalled app and it seems to be working again..you need to press the remote control bottom each time you open the washing machine to be able to access it by the app so what is the use . I could not select all the options available. ...it was not helpful to me..Really disappointed that my one year old OLED LG tv does not get webOS 4.0 update, which means I can\\'t connect tv to Google Home or Alexa, which means this app is useless to me. Avoid LG products, with built in obsolescence for 1 year old products!!.Not really useful. Diagnosis only say it working normal. Other LG AC Diagnosis serve better, more info and faster. For washer only give count down cycle. No status or counter at all.Unclear UI. Couldn\\'t edit wash program. Every time you tap something you have to wait 5 to 10 seconds to find out what it does. Poor..Not too informative. Does not connect to my 5G network. Could not correctly identify my issue with it\\'s diagnosis. Over all could use updating..I love this app! It allows me to monitor the progress of my washing and drying, and efficiently plan errands and other tasks..After the last update I have noticed I no longer receive end cycle notifications on my phone for my washer and dryer. Please fix this issue as that feature is the main reason i use the app anyway..Works well so far. It\\'s really handy for checking ore starting the washing machine :) The notifications are coming on time for my G7, my girlfriend\\'s G6 sometimes delays them (though it could be an aftereffect from battery saving).After last updates there are no push notifications. Every time I run the app it turns bluetooth on - what for? Please chcek last updates what happen, app was working OK before them. :-(.So confused, difficult to set up and use, ui is not pretty or intuitive. And the product came with absolutely no instructions on how to set it up with the app (smartfridge).I\\'ve used it once for an issue I thought I was gonna call a tech but thus helped me know I had to redistribute the weight inside. Once done it worked perfectly again..I have 9 kg steam model washer but in app some problems like late starting...also there should be customised option like jet spray should be involve in customisation option so that for better rinsing user can opt his best and time saving option manually through app.good for monitoring the washer-dryer, but controls are limited and more cumbersome than the actual machine. i can\\'t seem to start just the spin and dry functions..So far so good. Easily connected 3 appliances so far and they all are sending notifications promptly. Haven\\'t tried remote start on any of them yet..What a garbage app. I was trying to set up an LG tv, but no TV listed in device types, and the online instructions don\\'t work (no such app on my TV or in the LG app store)..3 flagship phone models later and I can finally connect albeit still with errors. only to find a boring lack luster list of washing cycles. I just want a 30 minute wash. This app stinks..Invasive and unnecessary mandatory permissions. Support claims \"they are necessary to proper functioning of the app\". App should function if the permissions are denied and just ask for country and wifi mac address..App is useless to me because it won\\'t run on a rooted device.  There is no reason for such a restriction.   One star for now.   I\\'ll look at it again if/when it runs on my device..The app works as expected, but is missing a crucial information for freezers: actual temperatures for cooler and freezer. Fix this and I will give 5 stars..I have a washing mashine. Sure I can see how long there is left on the wash. But nothing smart in it.  If I want to remotely start it. I have to activate remote start on the machine. Why it is not just on allways. And if I started normal I can\\'t stop it remotely. I have tried where the drying took 4 hours longer then it said. And I live in a apartment. So I would like to force it to stop no later then 21. No matter what. Also having an app would be nice it there was a digital leveler. That could tell if it was level or neede some adjustment.  And the mashine has build in. \"Be done in X hours\" why not via the app say \"Start at X.\" (I sometime come home late. And I do not care when it is done. Just that it do not start before 7).Love it for all of the remote functionality, but more importantly that my clothes get clean in this washer!.Love the app. Very helpful.Once you figure out the app it is easy to use. Not exactly how useful it will be but maybe. Definately willing to give it a try..Love this app.. Such a time saver.Living in Switzerland, you can\\'t even add a tv. No idea why this feature is country specific. Very disappointing because this disables the google assistant feature.I have registered my new lg fridge and got the verification email, clicked on verify but the app keeps telling me I\\'m not verified. Have had email resent and verified AGAIN, also re installed app but still not letting me in ????.This app turns on my Bluetooth every time I open it. It refuses to work without location and telephone permissions even though the app should be perfectly functional without it..PLEASE fix this app!!! Hasn\\'t worked at all since update. Get \"processing error. [0E]\" no matter what I do, can\\'t get past sign in screen! Please fix!!.The handy feature is displaying time remaining. Remote Start seems useless. Hopefully this is the start of a better app to come..Constantly disconnects and makes me start entire process of setting up my heat pump again. Often after resetting everything it cant control heat pumps anyway. Basically useless app..-slow to load the Air-conditioner screen -update has made the schedule option not work. \"Notice: Please retry for operation\" -Can\\'t put the air-conditioner on sleep mode via the app anymore.Would be great to be able to turn the washer on and off from the app. Also when cycles are finished to be able to control either making a new cycle or turning it off..can\\'t connect fridge to wifi followed directions on both the manual pdf and the app, it doesnt connect. also makes no sense since my fridge doesnt have the capability of entering in a password for my router.Needs access to phone calls to work? Really? Just to get info about the country? Why not just provide a drop-down and I\\'ll select my country. Why do you need to know the country to work anyways? Uninstalled this app.it tells me how cold my fridge is... it allows me to change the fridge temperature while im mobile.... i never change the fridge temperature after its set... whats the point? it works though, ive tried it.I take back my first bad review, it turned out to be my router, after a hard restart, I was able to connect again..love the app.For whatever reason my location is needed for me to utilize this app in order to connect with my washer and dryer. It was bad enough I gave the app management oversight over my phone calls..I would like the app to automatically push alerts to Alexa without me asking Alexa for a cycle status. I do like the app overall and have put it to good use..No matter how I try to log in or create an account I always get a \"information that you entered does not comply with terms of service.\".Tried several times, to connect. Erased cache and data tried setup again; \\'Authentication error occured\" error. Uninstalled, reinstall but I receive a \"authentication error occurred\" everytime. UNINSTALLED...was working really well until the last upgrade and I now have to reconnect ALL my devices as ALL have been removed from the app. very frustrating and time consuming!.Nice app scheuling could be improved by adding more than one schedule..Works great even when i was away from home.not working. its not registering my tv even after all the steps.....just not conecting my tv to alexa sucks. i am not a computer geek and this app is suppose to be easy..stopped working again, ugh. the app loads but it never connects to the refrigerator. i have tried removing the app and adding back. i have tried reconnecting the refrigerator and it did not.No, it doesn\\'t need my location or be able to do calls. It\\'s just like my last LG phone, great hardware but useless outdated software. EDIT: so why it\\'s not mentioned anywhere? And what about call permission?.As has been said, this app wants far too many permissions for what it is. What my location has to do with anything is beyond me, the washing machine is sat in my house, I don\\'t carry it around with me, and it certainly is not going to make phone calls on my behalf. The connection should be the same as I make with any printer or fax machine, paired to my device..I like this app! It\\'s nice that it will let me know when the cycle is complete. Then I don\\'t forget my wash for hours at a time!.I have an LG washing machine and dishwasher. It\\'s helpful to receive notifications when wash cycles are done. no issues with app so far..THINQ concept for LG FHT series is still under development. we need typical remote control panel in application to make life more easy. for example play/ pasue control in the app..Read the Privacy Policy. Very intrusive - LG wants to have permission to totally access your mobile device..very bad every time server error message come and can\\'t connect with a product.Bought smart top load washer. App cant find the washer even though the icons all over the washer/dryer say it should work..Easy and Time consuming.AMAZING !!! THOROUGHLY IMPRESSED.Does\\'t link brand new fridge with S8 Active. I am using WPA2, English only characters and 2.4 GHz network. Reset router, phone and even unplug frodge to make it work.....nothing.Many other complain about the same thing.I just got an LG AC ? KSQ24ENXA and am not able to connect it tk LG SMART THINQ... Trust me i paid whopping 60,000 for it.... And online it is said that it does get connected but here i have tried unnumbered times but it does not connect... Please help me!!.Good app - still learning, and there seem to be some glitches on allowing me to change settings once it is on remote..On the 3rd day of using app, cannot log in anymore. Also relogging takes a while and is annoying to use as a regular controller.I don\\'t know about these smartasses talking about permissions, i tried the app and logically all permissions are set to specific use/type of products and generally those storage, phone and location permissions are set to give the app ability to know the country you use/bought the product in so the app determines which models in that type are shipped to that country.. also storage is explained as the use to download software and files IF necessary, and what\\'s wrong with lge collecting this type of that, furthermore if any app wants to know who you are it surely will not even giving permission to, i am a developer and i know how it works, and here i come to thank lge for making such a useful app, an extremely useful app with amazing ux also almost a clean ui.awesome app but very slow, I get that it\\'s free and I shouldn\\'t expect more but come on it takes forever to load..i use Google assistant to turn on my lg tv and change between hdmi inputs. she responds with \"getting lg\" and then i have to listen to this gay, cringeworthy, god awful, voice respond to my command. i hate it. my girl friend hates it. change the voice. mute it. i don\\'t care. everything else works fine though..the app is great, but i can\\'t modify cycle s for mz washer, i wanna made my own programs and cycles. To fix the program and not flexibile. When i can personalize the stuffs like c, time, spin etc.. i can give 5 star...Room for improvement. It can take several minutes for the app to sync with the current status of the laundry machines..excellent app. no more guessing when my wash or dryer is done I also use it for my dishwasher and microwave. I\\'m very happy..Unusable, cannot sign in or create account using any method. \"The information you provided does not comply with our Terms of Service\" after entering birth date..its good effort by LG towards smart devices but they have long way to go. The platform is very slow and buggy but I appreciate the effort..no support not able to connect, just as hard to reach support as connection of the ac to the app, both failed, wish i had gone with an app that is more plug and play like Samsung.Scheduling function broken in recent update. No matter what start/stop times I choose for my A/C unit, it just picks a random time instead after saving the schedule..The app doesn\\'t connect with our Wireless Network, which it is impossible to connect and control our air conditioner from our cellphone..connecting my smart ac to wifi and finishing the firmware update has proven impossible after hours of troubleshooting.Great! No more open doors.Couldn\\'t get beyond registering/logging in (w Facebook? Really?) Because of \"invalid headers\" after trying to submit. Boo..All I wanted this app for was to have a timer on my washer and dryer, cause its down in my cold basement. But it only gave me the option to download special washes or dryer settings..absolutely awful. I have a masters degree in IT and spent 2 hours on phone to Alexa customer services and changed between 2.5 ghz and 5ghz. It doesn\\'t work. Why make an app that is unusable?.I have tried all the things in their trouble shooting list, but my new refrigerator will not complete the \"registration\" process so no wifi connection. now i have to decide if its worth pursuing under warranty. Not impressed..Cant turn dishwasher off or on with this app. Its limited to only letting you when it\\'s done and to download wash cycles. And you have to reconnect the dishwasher every time its powered off..The app used to work, now my dryer is making a horrible noise and the app update doesn\\'t see the NFC tag on either the washer or dryer. So now that I need it it\\'s broken..Doesnt support LG ovens with an NFC tag even though the oven manual says it does. The link you get when reading the NFC tag on the oven is invalid (points to non existant app: com.lg.apps.lgoven.us).You need to try to figure out an acceptable ID. Good luck! This app wants all uour contacts and to manage all your phone calls. Puuulease Just Stop Making These CRAPPY APPS! All I wanted to do was control my damn dishwasher. ??.Dear LG, I\\'ve now been promised support for my washing machine for the past two and a half years, but alas, it\\'s still not fully supported. I can\\'t run a regular wash program and I can\\'t use the dryer function. I can only upload some useless programs that I have no need for. The old app which worked well, was removed a few months after purchasing the washer and replaced by this complex, useless, turd of an app. Unfortunately I can\\'t read the settings on the washing machine itself, as they\\'re in Chinese, so when my other half isn\\'t home, I can\\'t do the laundry thanks to your useless app. Do you think I would be buying another LG appliance?.Completely useless. It will not register my LG TV, and it turns out Alexa will work without the app. So it makes it even more useless..the app keeps old information instead of the new you have to keep turning it on and off to get what\\'s actually happening with the dryer or washer overly complicated.Outrageous permissions needed. So i decline to give you access to my phone contacts list and you decline to install. Why do you need that? And more to the point why code the app so it won\\'t install without it. I don\\'t want LG to have my contacts list thank you , so uninstalling now..Pretty disappointing in the reliability of app there needs to be some serious testing done to get to this app up to scratch, slow and unreliable at best not exactly feature rich..No IFTTT support.It has gotten better, but I don\\'t like that notifications turn my screen on every time they go off. there should be an option to turn that off..Cant connect with nfc to wash machine. i try so many times, but its not working, also there is a icon on machine that you have close your device until they connect..Intrusive Notifications! There\\'s no reason your notifications need to overlay other apps. Please switch to using built-in notifications like every other app!.The app worked ok before. Now it won\\'t install and shows \"Insufficient storage\". I have 1.7GB space in the device. Please look into it, LG..Doesn\\'t work. When I log in using the LG account the error I get is Invalid Request Headers. Don\\'t waste your time..App was ok before the latest update. Now I have to log in to control a device on my network? Defeats any convenience there was..Great when it works, too often it doesn\\'t tell me when a cycle is done though. If it did it would be 5 stars.Very easy to use for appliances and full of great tips for all of LG\\'s wonderful products. No complaints thus far..Possibly the worst app in the store. terrible user interface, drops connections to air conditioning units regularly and is in general painful to use..wants more permissions than is needed for working properly. i dont trust what the app is doing with the additional data it claims it needs access to..So cool that I can keep tabs on my air and water filter status... Control my fridge and freezer Temps, and even turn on ice plus to generate more ice on demand..Unable to install - not a problem with my device. New TV being returned for refund in the morning. Should\\'ve stuck with Sony..won\\'t let me connect to my Alexa device; extremely poor design.It takes To long to start rhis app..about a/c: can u make \"turn off only schedule\" mode pls? i just want it to turn off at the same time everyday (i turn on my a/c in the different time) thank you.I love the app. very helpful to let me know if someone in the house is using the washing machine. I can also plan my washing accordingly. great tool..Doesn\\'t work on rooted devices for whatever reason. My banking apps doesn\\'t restrict me so I don\\'t really see the point of a smart controller restricting rooted devices from using it..First time opening it and the shows an error message that I need to log in to use the app. Unfortunately I can\\'t get past it to log in..Just purchased a new Refrigerator and Stove thought that the ThinQ would be a great feature but there is no need for upfront permissions for location and pictures. Now I have useless \"Smart\" devices in my home. Thanks LG..\"Cant run on rooted device\" Why not? Are you scared someone might find flaws in your code? Edit: Use Magisk Hide if you want to use this app, it worked for me!.Been more than a week and when the app is open. It is always trying to download product info. To the extend I cannot remote anything at all.good as far as it goes. allowing multiple phones/accounts to connect at the same time would be an improvement..Worst app ever. Developer must consult a medic. After input ID and pass ask again how I want to login. My choose is LG ID and again ask for ID and pass. Again and again..confusing setup. Can\\'t even tell you what model appliances you have. Limited in terms of usefulness. A toy at best..I regret buying this washer and dryer. Washer will not connect to wifi. Dryer has connected to Alexa, but does nothing unless you physically turn on remote access. Very dissatisfied..Love this app. Lets you know the status and control your appliance..Great app for a great machine.Can not connect to dryer.User friendly. Nice app..Pretty handy, and built in. Not like Samsung where ut costs extra ti add module to automate)manage. Needs better/faster way to manage deletiin of notifications..Good start just not enough real time feedback from the app - it is a little too light on detail..App does not work properly. Unable connect my dishwasher. Followed all instructions and it thinks there is no internet connection when there is..Great Assistant when i have multiple things going on, it helps to me keep perfect track of my laundry staus so i can pull clothes accordjngly to avoid wrinkles and unnecessary ironing, YEA!.I don\\'t understand why you need to collect pictures or audio when I activate my camera or voice services. No thank you. This is a washing machine..I just deleted it because my phone\\'s battery use list said it had used the highest amount of battery since this morning, with 13 hours of active use and no background use. I haven\\'t opened the app in probably a month....App took a bit of time to setup but works now. On my washing machine after a few cycles if still doesnt show any energy usage..Start app, loading wheel for mins, message saying to sign in and retry and then everything repeats over and over no matter what is pressed..overly invasive . In order to launch the app I have to give LG permission to access my call history and manage phone calls, with the excuse \"to ensure the right language\" is used in app. rediculous..Still getting used too, easy to use.The functionality is truely futuristic. Wondering what LG will come up with next.This app helps a busy mom like me. Thanks LG!.App is nice and easy with just what is needed..Okay for knowing how much time left on the laundry you\\'re doing. Also you get to know how many times you\\'ve done laundry. It\\'s good at these, that\\'s it. Needs more functionality..Good app. does about what you\\'d expect. Sends alerts when the door/s are left open..it takes a little bit of time for it to figure how much time the cycle has left (might be my slow wifi) but besides that no complaints!.Have to sign in with Facebook or google, and too many permissions, why do you need access to my contacts? Why can\\'t I just use the app without signing in to anything?.Downloaded this as my new tv is thinq ai compatible. Tried to register the tv and got nowhere. That\\'s despite signing in to my lg uk account. Disappointing as I was hoping to use this app a lot..The company should have uploaded the latest tutorial video of how to connect my phone to my LG ac unit. I couldn\\'t do the connection using info from the old video in YouTube..My ACs permanently show as disconnected since the last update. Nothing helps. So, in short, the app just became useless..after june update problems start. air conditioner cant be reached. i have tried to add again but the app dont recognize the device. email sent today 19/07/2019. waiting feedback...thanks.I like that I can see when my laundry is finished. I would however like to able to add an extra spin cycle from the app if I chose..app crashed every time i tried to set it up. And my device is not rooted app just sucks.Great and very helpful..it\\'s quite helpfull to have control of my home appliance although it has limited function. hopefully it will have more features in the future.Ridiculous! An app that is meant to control my washer wants access to make and receive calls!! And have access to my media... And won\\'t work without those permission S!.Brand new 65UK77 - connects with Echo, turns TV off, changes channels, does not turn TV on. Not very useful sunce remote control needed everytime you watch TV.I am unable to use Google Home conmectivity and IFFFt or Alexa connectivity in India. i would like that to be available. This is a sore miss from LG..Can\\'t even open the app I keep getting an error message. After I sign in it says \" invalid request headers¡°. App is useless as of now.The only thing this is good for is notifying me as to when my dryer is done drying. it\\'s frustrating because it\\'d be much handier if I could RESTART my dryer remotely.....THE APP DOES NOT WORK WITH MY PHONE (SAMSUNG S8) MY HISBAND DOWNLOADED AND HAS NO PROBLEM WITH IPHONE. app sucks. You have to aleays go and press the remote start button no point in app or wifi...I can\\'t find where to state that the water filter has been changed, and no too many useful tools..Provide a manual method in inputting required information. Also, why would you need my GPS location? Make and manage phone calls, make it optional for the functionality your selling. Too many permissions required. if this is what LG believes to be acceptable, I will no longer purchase any of their products..very helpful as we don\\'t have to c again nd again whether d cycle is finished or not. It works even when we are out nd we can change or stop d cycle from our mobile .I luv it..App loads slowly and responds very slowly to google assistant. Also, the controller settings don\\'t persist sometimes if I open the app..i like the app, but would be nice if you could start the washer and dryer without having to activate remote start every time. that\\'s silly.this is so easy to use. I\\'m able to keep up with the laundry. No more smelly cloths because they were left in the machine to long..bought a new tv and it told me to download this app. followed the instructions and made sure the phone and tv were on the same network. app couldn\\'t find my tv..\"Connecting to product\" always stuck at 40%, and what the hell is \"back button isn\\'t available\"?.very bad Wi-Fi lg aircon system . since bought it 10 times call to customer service And then call to lg technician they did not figure it out whats the problem with Wi-Fi. they hang up phone. strongly recommend never ever buy lg aircon \\'refrigerator..Way too many unnecessary permissions. Doesn\\'t support smart diagnosis for *very recently* purchased appliance bc the appliance doesn\\'t have an NFC tag..Seems to work okay. I can\\'t really trust the time remaining, but the rest of the features are functional..Can finally sign back into app but my refrigerator won\\'t connect. It worked several months ago but can\\'t reconnect. What an absolute waste!.Keeps saying doesnt work on rooted device. My phone is not rooted. This is why I left lg phones. May have to return their dishwashers too..well most of it is good easy to use but the the time delay between loading a any feature and time delay between the ac and app transmitting commands is bit too slow.Seems awesome! Look for asterisk interactions. I love being notified when my clothes are dry..Nice product. works as advertised, very quiet, makes tons of ice, has tons of space. we love it..Can\\'t connect my TV to the app, and built in Google assistant doesn\\'t have access to my smart home devices. Disappointing ..Takes a huge amount of time to connect. You have to actually open and close the bottom of fridge door continuous 5times in 8 seconds.Lovedrhos for the first month with my split unit. Hasn\\'t worked in 6 months. Tried uninstalling but it just won\\'t link up and customer support is useless..Force closes without location or phone hmm sounds salty for an app that controls my washing machine to shut down because I won\\'t tell it where I live but lacking these permissions should not force close the app but their denial seemly does had i known something so simple i would\\'ve gone with a Samsung machine for a similar price..App requires location, access to files, and access to phone functions. Unnecessarily intrusive..Nice to monitor status. Would be helpful to be able to turn ice making on/off remotely..App will not start. Keeps giving the error message \"can not run on rooted device\" even though my phone is not rooted.i cant connect with my tv. incharge said that the password of the tv is 12345678 but it didn\\'t work, i try also 00000000 and also it won\\'t connect i\\'m kinda tired of it.....while it didn\\'t find the problem, LG customer support was very helpful and persistent! Thank you Ben..LG not working with IFTTT. I have a brand new LG washer and dryer that is unable to show uo in IFTTT. This is an issue. Would give 0 stars if possible.Doesn\\'t work with Android 10, so don\\'t bother with it yet..app is very unresponsive for the new LG fan purchased on 4 July 2019.Works, sometimes a little slow to respond..Very usefull and necesary.I installed this app and after consistantly shutting down, I uninstalled this app 10 minutes later. I should have looked at the reviews before wasting my time with this app. For those of you in charge, my best advice is to clean house and start over with an app that actually works. Pathetic.Found the error code on washing machine and how to sort. But only worked when turned nfc on a message that it was turned off may have been usefull.I love my washer/dryer and the app. For me everything works great. I purchased the washer/dryer for the direct drive motor. Very easy to use and efficient..why do i need an account to connect to a device what kind of architecture is this, I\\'m only interested in connecting to the device in the internal network anyway also, permission to make calls and get my location.. please...very nice feature. Hoping to buy more LG products. the interface needs upgradation. not as smooth as Xiaomi Home..The latest update broke the ability to log in to an LG account on a Pixel 3 in the US. US devices do not use Android System Webview anymore, they use Chrome Webview..Way too much loading even when both my phone and the appliance are connected to the same WiFi network..just bought myself a s.b.s. refrigerator...and was completely satisfied with the functioning of the refrigerator and the app...majorly the diagnostic feature is quite helpful.Perfect App to control products with good interface. Using it for Aircon and Refrigerator and it is working absolutely fine..Easy to work with..awesome i can use my phone to check washer problems.Used to work... This app worked before the last update. Now all it does is crash as soon as I open it!.useless have 2 lg smart tv and dvd. too many permissions and access to my data and acvounts This is the best LG can come up with? They need some changes...terible actually. Doesnt work with alexia..I just downloaded the app and it won\\'t even open. Uninstalled app, restarted my phone, reinstalled the app and it still doesn\\'t work. Worthless!!!.App wont allow you to create a wash program or even shorten existing cycles or programs. There is only one downloadable wash cycle \"small load\". A waste of time..Easy to download (you have to be on the 2.4Ghz network, NOT 5Ghz) and connect the washer and dryer. Sweet!.App is slow. Needs to show more info in terms of energy consumption and water..Can\\'t get paat the log in screen. Attempted to log in with google AND LG- takes me right back to the log in screen..took a bit to get the initial setup... and still learning but if it works as advertised 5 stars is hardly enough..great use only thing is you always have to press REMOTE START to start your wash or dry with the app which is a little bit annoying other than that it works fine.Useless. Tried numerous times to sign into my LG account, and no go. No problem accessing my LG account on my computer browser..Good for checking on settings, needs a way to check inside temperature and or alerts, not sure what the ice plus does..Such a waste app.. Ntg wrkng... Ntg opng its going blank again n again i just wasted my tym...... By restartng my mobile n failed again.. Its nt chngng country nt showng anythng inlu rounding n blank unable to sign in too..... I had trust it will wrk so i was chckng n crrctng my mobile..... Very much disappointed ??dnt wanna give a star but no option...Current Power Consumption Based on 0:00 200kWh... I know you say it may vary slightly, but this is definetly bugged for an AC....Smart products and smart App. Thanks LG to make it live easier..Requires location and phone access for no good reason..Brilliant app very useful but would be even better if we had a notification saying that our washer machine has finished etc..Test with lg dishwasher without problems,this app does tell me the past usage pattern, such as open the door while operation. Tell me to use extra rinse options and delay start options..what a lousy app. was promised by the salesman that the washing machine works with this smart thinQ app. It even has the logo. However, upon trying to register my WFT9081DD, the app says I am unable to register this product wth?.Will not log in. keeps saying no response from server. Edit: was able to log in and register the dryer now, but cannot get the washing machine to register..After creating account and logging in, I just continually get looped back to log in screen..Dryer is working well. Very quiet and clothes come out clean and dry first time around No need for a second cycle..Created an account to use app for washer and dryer. Couldn\\'t get past the log in page after the effort as it kept giving an error message.This app has never worked with my phone which is infuriating because I bought an LG smart tv to go with my LG phone (stylo 4).... I\\'m so close to returning this TV.Very cool to diagnose problem with appliance..! But brand new so hope won\\'t be having a problem..!.just needed to add a program to my NFC washer (no wifi). The app needed so many permissions and creation of an account for this. How ridiculous..Set aircon to automatically turn on then an update broke connectivity now cannot reconnect aircon to wifi to change this setting and aircon automatically turns on every day despite being deleted from app..frustrating, had a hard time getting past loging in. something was preventing the \"sign in\" button ffom highlighting?????.easy to use to connect to my fridge and monitor it.this app is so damn confusing! i cant even control it from my phone.. none of the buttons light up or anything and its set up cause i can see the time i have left for my loads of laundry.. ugghh.Used to work fine. Since latest update cannot remote start my washing machine or dryer..Okay I bought a TV, I downloaded this app and it says that it won\\'t work on a rooted device.     ... My device is not rooted..seems to work for my washer and dryer. i like the multipke wash/dry settings in the app. I could probably do this by hand on the unit but I\\'m a bit lazy and like the techy stuff :).Will not run with out phone call permissions and location permission. these are not needed to control most of your devices. run this app on a restricted phone with no gps or sim enabled.Great App for great Appliances. Still working on linking the new fridge, but we love it all..Cant login into application. your date of birth and terms and conditions page itself have issues. Really not worth the time.it IS nice to have this app, but there\\'s been a few times the dishwasher won\\'t start and I don\\'t understand why, wish it would give help for that.Works as advertised!!! I like it.Absolutely useless!!! Even more, they want all the data that app is able to collect and after want a permission to transfer it overseas?.Doesn\\'t allow use of rooted device. Probably block it because I could prevent it from seeing my location and other weird permission the app shouldn\\'t need..Devices show as disconnected in the app, when they\\'re clearly connected to the network..there is no reason you need to block rooted devices. takes me an extra 2 minutes to hide root and use anyways but why make me go theough the added trouble?.App has a nasty bug where if you deny it location access it will spike one cpu core to 100% permanently and drain the battery fast..Want to use Alexa to control TV. Have downloaded app, but keep getting error trying to create an account..A good app overall .. What I woul like to know is the energy consumption of each device the moment it\\'s active...That would de extraordinary.Complete dud, unable to connect up my fridge, and frankly, what\\'s the point anyway? Shame on me for trying in the first place..need to create sensors for other brand of appliances and electronics..Cannot add brand new Wifi washing machine.It is not reliable. The application often exits due to the inability to contact the server..super nice being able to know how long or when your cycle is done just by a notification..this applicatuon saves a lot of time.. instead of calling customer support, this app easily detects the faults, as they say!.Tends to disconnect from the Wi-Fi a lot. Stopped sending a signal to my phone..Wide open privacy terms and why do you want to make calls on my phone?. wifi is not a usable feature with these terms and conditions! so a useless feature for me.Useless. \"won\\'t run on a rooted device\". It is not rooted..app will not open, cant even log in, worked fine until a couple days ago. please fix the app, ridiculous..Won\\'t work... Simply won\\'t even find my LG TV. So it\\'s useless, tried uninstalling & reinstalling several times..It took me a minute to figure out how to make it notify me with sound, but after that it is a great app..it opens my Bluetooth without any consent even if i turn it off, every time I open this app the Bluetooth turns on automatically and the notifications do not work.clearly Useful app, but its working speed is really slow. Makers need improvement in this area!.previous energy monitoring module is best than this one i request to the developer please change this module to the previous one as that one is display the current energy consumption but this one not...it was good not great, took time to connect (-1), but worked. last update removed sleep mode from the app controls (-1)..Tv is advertised as works with google assistant, however I can the Smart thinQ account to pair with google. is this a temporary glitch?.Doesn\\'t work with microwave....Your app is can\\'t login via Facebook gmail and normal login.Helped troubleshoot water supply problem. Worked as described.worst app I have ever used. Very tedious to connect a product with app. Don\\'t understand why this app is of 70MB size. useless app. App used work better before update though..this app wont even open anymore since last update . I just moved in this house with all lg products now . The app dosent work please fix..Why just why won\\'t it run o rooted devices. Looking forward to resolving this issue.June 10, 2019 update makes this app so slooooow. Can\\'t even connect to Google Home because of \"country restriction\"..Pretty easy to use but needs a little bit more customization..before sign in often stop this app. several time reinstalled ,but unresolved this issue in my phone .LG G6 and android v8..Too many permissions and login/eulas to accept, no thanks. I just wanted to see what the nfc thing with my washing machine was..I have a Galaxy S10. When attempting to setup dishwasher the first step doesn\\'t have a \\'next\\' button, so I can\\'t complete the setup. Daughter has an iPhone and it works fine..the app sucks separately the AC I bought for 60k is the most worthless piece of plastic, the customer care ppl wont listen till your 1 year is over , and then irritate you post that just asking for more money , WORST APP WORST AC AND WORST CUSTOMERS SERVICE THERE EVER CAN BE..Just wont install on Samsung s10. Sits 99% forever.does not connect to wifi, if it does connect eventually it will then disconnect & not connect again. terrible app.This app is so awesome! I love it when you can already turn on your ac while you\\'re still on your way home..Though the App worked as intended was disappointed that I couldn\\'t control or change settings on the refrigerator..Great!! It helped me figure out that my water supply hose was clogged with silt build up..Not synchronizing with google home. Says service not available in your country (Lebanon)!!.Integration with IFTTT ? power consumption in watts and watt hour ? Integration with alexa and google home ? when do we get all these features ??.Useful app for the notifications, but the rest is kinda terrible. A lot of bugs..This app explained what was wrong and I fixed my machine by myself. Great job..wont connect via tag on either washer or dryer! tried over and over. nfc enabled. even power cycled phone. pixel 3.This is setup in a way that feels comfortable and effortless when using, everything is easy find or access.it doesnt work on my Samsung s8+ for some reason. cannot register cannot do anything keep saying error on every parts..This garbage is not working on my Huawei Mate 10. Yes, I have switch off the 5 GHz network and it\\'s working on my wife\\'s iPhone..Its inconsistent abd nreds frequent checks on WiFi etc..The wash cycle would not complete. I diagnosed it and it told me the problem. I fixed it. Wonderful!.App works exactly as expected. Connected easily with Washing machine and Dryer..keeps crashing the min you open app reinstalled and still wont work, looked online, seems to be a common problem for alot of people.i its easier than connecting to amazon dot but the room temp on my remote shows lower than my app temp i trust remote one more for room temp and for rest this app is awsm....Tried to open, error message says can\\'t run on a rooted phone. I do not have a rooted phone..Using Samsung s9 on Pie NFC is on keeps saying item not found. Why? Bought this machine to diagnose and download so far not impressed..Other than reporting filter change at random intervals. I\\'ve had a fa tastic experience with LG.So much easier to multitask and not miss a finished load, love it !!.why the heck do I need to log in again and again? happens almost every week. honor play android 9....cannot connect well with TV, doesn\\'t turn on via mobile, cannot be detected by Google Home.app doesn\\'t serve much of a purpose. it can set the frig temp but does not tell you what the actual frig temp is..tried multiple times to.download this app and it keeps resetting. disappointing..Most recent update seems to have broken wifi connection. I can not use the app anymore to control the AC.it works, handy to control appliances, no need use buttons or knobs, all presets available on phone.My registered TV does not show up on the app after many attempts and different LG accounts, useless!.I have a lg V30 and it won\\'t sync to Google Home. Update: their generic response is what I already tried. So frustrating.Worked 1st time. Now it stopped working. Just some gibberish and no buttons and locks up so I have to kill the app.The app just repeats an error message to login and never gives the option to login or create an account..your app does not need my location, be able to make phone calls or messages or change my phone settings in order for it to work. now that I cannot use your diagnostic tool to fix your product I will find another company..Our washing machine would not drain the water all of a sudden. This app helped me fix it in 5 mins ??.Great but how about being able to download different songs when dryer or washer turns off..Very useful. I left the door open and got a notice. This may be the nicest appliance we own..It would be nice if it was possible to modify preinstalled programs. Now I can save custom programs only to Download cycle slot..doesn\\'t work from last week, says network instability hope things get back to normal soon.why bluetooth is automatically getting turned on ,when i open this app.?.I use this app for AC connecting via wifi..I cant even download the app..it says dowload pending and nothing is happening...yes I have great wifi and I tried it without it as well and nithing..reports issues that i believe are not there. Still reports water/air filters as needing to be changed after i replaced them..Device Won\\'t Connect to WiFi. I have two strong WiFi networks and the device won\\'t connect to either of them . . ..I\\'ve used it to download cycles to washer and it works well for that. Might be easier if I didn\\'t have to register to do that, but it\\'s okay..Using with a combo washer dryer. 1. Need hacker skills to even register the product. 2. when connected, i can only see the settings i chose MANUALLY on the machine by turning the program selector and pushing the buttons 3. no option to select and CHANGE washing program parameters within the app 4. not possibly to save my CUSTOM program settings as favourites 5. only ONE program to be downloaded at once?? 6. why do i need to see the accu.weather forecast on half of the app screen? 7. remote start with the app makes no sense, as you have to set everything manually anyway, and so you can just use the delay function button on the machine instead. 8. how to turn off the wifi on the washing machine? i don\\'t need it anymore, but it keeps connecting, and pressing the wifi button for even 3 sec does nothing.  All you can do with this app is just to see (not change) the program you set manually, start the washing remotely (if can\\'t calculate the delay in advance), and turn off the machine.  2019 not smart app..Unacceptable terms and conditions. Install cancelled!.poorly designed, difficult to connect, difficult to log in, not worth the download time.App needs an update. it keeps stopping with my Samsung and negates any value with wi-fi appliance..Instructions for installing the software are terrible. Spent an hour trying to connect to the washer/dryer before finding out it uses bluetooth instead of wi-fi..Registration required for local use. So it\\'s personal data you want..Waste of time - doesn\\'t connect to washing machine if you don\\'t have NFC. Don\\'t bother here..waist of time. every time i try to connect device it closes and wont open. useless!.update crashes but before it does it turns bluetooth on when it tries to notify. avoid until fixed. lgv30+ android 8.0.0.this app is amazing... instead of me wasting money getting someone to come look at why my appliance isnt working, the app tells me exactly whats wrong and i can fix it myself.The app wants permissions that it shouldn\\'t need. I declined. Sounds like I\\'m not missing much; the reviews are terrible..very useful and fix the problem i had on my fridge after a few weeks of not knowing. took me literaly only 1 minute. NICE.Only allow connections via wifi only. Many times attempts to login but failed or unresponsive..Works fine, at home or on the go to control my air conditioners.Not sure about the value of this app. Seriously. Adds zero functionality and zero capabilities. Only useful thing that I hope it did is register the product to my name..Keep showing \"you need to log in\".. I can not open this apps... Maybe after update.. My phone is huawei p20pro...Useless app. Worked for about 5 minutes then stopped. Now TV not recognised anymore..doesn\\'t work with mini split ac. won\\'t turn off or on. junk.just now hooked it up tonight window AC and it works great wasn\\'t hard to set up or anyting. it might help though that I have a thin Q phone also.the fact that I have to allow you all my information on my phone to include my location or making me share this app to either my Facebook Instagram Amazon account is ridiculous I don\\'t feel I need to give you any personal information whatsoever in order to use an app that is linked or an option to a product that I have purchased by LG.Not very useful app. At least there is no timer for the washing machine to alert when it finishes..not very much to configure. energy usage is over simplified and doesnt show any actual data..have to keep reinstalling one of my mini splits says disconnected on the app? didn\\'t have problems until the last update?.Pretty cool function to monitor or change what\\'s happening with my new washer and dryer. Thanks LG!.Works great on all my lg appliances, such as LG washer, LG dryer, and LG TV! Deffently recommend app!.Not necessary but handy..Very good experience.Too slow and the notification popup is annoying and cannot be turned of..nothing extraordinary, basic info that can be read right off the button panel..Does not allow you to modify a cycle. can only download cycles preconfigured by LG. So ftont panel is more useful.Cannot register new fridge like a lot of the other comments. Utterly useless.can\\'t change temperature on window ac. temperature is blank on app. have to clear cache for it to work.Does exactly what it\\'s supposed to do. Nice being able to check remaining time and getting finished notificstion.Took forever to get appliances on app.im just buying a new stove. this two year old peice of junk goes to scrap. hope u enjoyed my money, u wont be getting any more. why do i need a password, my location, access to my phone just to diognose my stove. pry on somebody else. mind your own buisness..doesn\\'t work. tried multiple times, but the smart diagnosis fails every time..works nice with my washing machine, the app loads a little bit slow..After recent update, the app opens and works as designed/advertised. Great app and hopefully doesn\\'t bug out again..Works fine but all I can do is start, pause, or power off.need to update the app\\'s its slowing connectivity, but this is very useful I rate 3 stars..Still needs lot of modifications, options are not easily accessible and it should be user friendly.Spying app from LG. Requires your phone, location, wifi and account with allowed spying polices to interact with lg stuff... nice work.Unusable Did work but lost connection, once able to reinstall device (airco) but after power failure unable to te-add airco..Love it even our washing machine has manners.Constantly disconnects. You have to stop/restart the app to get an status update. kinda useless..Grabbing data for a damned app to interface a washing machine? Nope not having any damned details. Uninstalled.very helpful.. easy registration.. problem fixed with my washer in 10 minutes, very helpful.Great time saver and convenient. Really like that you can be anywhere and it sends you notifications.Works great but LG can you please put the full name in app as LG Smart ThinQ? Should be able to search apps for LG and have it come up..Does not work on Android tablets. Not even able to download from playstore. False advertising on Lgs part as only works on mobile phones and not tablets..It won\\'t install, sticks at 99% every time. 5 tries but still won\\'t work..says \"cannot run on rooted phone\". my phone isnt rooted..I\\'d give this no stars if possible. Useless with LG wifi air-conditioning. LG offers zero support and ignores users with same issue on their LG forums..I don\\'t find any TVs in the product list. Hence I cannot connect my TV.Just another app predicated on stealing data in exchange for extremely limited functionality..A rubbish app. Have read the manuals and the YouTube videos and still failed to connect my GC-B247SLUV fridge..New update for the energy monitor is very bad, please revert to the old one..i have to reconnect my washer every time I turn it on. the connection to if this then that also no longer works..It lets me delay the start. Havent been able to change or set up settings shown on the app..Mandatory location and phone call permissions.Stupidity of turning off the water and not being sure why the machine was in error was easily rectified.Galaxy S8 \"Cannot run on a rooted device\" This is a new phone that is factory - it is NOT rooted.Awesome! No longer leave clothes sitting in the washer or dryer!.useless app, cant even connect to the washer i bought when it shows no wifi connection when i have my wifi working fine..Tried several times and can\\'t connect my new LG model WT7300CW washer. LG customer service wasn\\'t really helpful. ??.i followed the instruction for the diagnistic procedures and after then, my washer started working normally... the error results are not exactly the problem...fantastic to see what the cycle is up to. easy to use! Love it.This app is no joke or gimmick. LG is really making this app work flawlessly while making it look visually intuitive..Was a five star until recent update and crashed my app. Can\\'t connect to fridge. I\\'m using OnePlus 6t.Does what it\\'s supposed to on my phone, but won\\'t install on my Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 (tablet), so this might not work with your Android device..A lot of useful functionalities: downloading cycles to the washer and diagnosing make this app really useful.Why the h¢æll LG suggested to install this App to control my new LG 43UK6300PTE with Alexa? This app does not even lists TVs to connect..It is taking so much time to connect with AC from this app..Garbage. Not linking my stove to Facebook in order to use smart diagnosis, and app just errors trying to log in with an LG account.Worked to determine over crowding issue in freezer. Issue corrected and fan noise went away..the app loading is slow and everytime items need to reconnect especially the washer it takes very long to connect.So far it reaches my expectation. Nice to have this app to control my appliance and get the notifications from appliance..consistently fails to connect to my fridge. no troubleshooting info to help..Just confusing...when having to dowload type of wash everytime.Couldn\\'t create login because server was down.Horrible... I absolutely cannot get this app to even download ?? Is there a different app available so I can link my LG TV and appliances?.having to turn on remote start from unit sucks. especially when your washer is down in the basement.Cannot setup wifi on clothes washer with Huawei P20. Other people have reported this as well..I like it it is a good thing that you can Tag On your device and check if everything goes well. amazing..App doesn\\'t work. Blank screen then shuts down. Please help!.App crashes while connected to WiFi. can not set up new ac..it\\'s perfect! I live upstairs from my machines so the alert when finished is wonderful.Cannot run on a rooted device. My device is not rooted..It works great just hate the stuff you have to allow in order to use it. Like make and manage your calls..???.Cannot work with my Tag on washing machine. My washing machine turn off after download the cycle, and it cannot turn on until unplug..Installed and nothing. Doesn\\'t do anything. Error, try again..Hi, I keep getting error that no response received from server and the app closes on its own. Is this app not functional in UAE?.Used for my fridge. Worked great..If you want to use the app, you are obliged to grant them location and call management access. If you don\\'t grant them access, you cannot use the app. I don\\'t think it\\'s fair (to be coerced) to give my location and call management data away for free, to be monetised elsewhere, having already paid in the first place to use the product as advertised. Says a lot about LG\\'s corporate philosophy. Access denied. Uninstalled..Limited phone have NFC.Please, Add all the functionality in the app which is available in remote for split AC..So helpful! Washer and dyer are in detached garage and this makes knowing when they are done so easy!.Love this app and the tag on function. no more need for a paper manual.couldn\\'t figure out why the washer wouldnt drain. connected the app and solved the problem.It would be nice to start and turn off the dishwasher using the app. It also would be nice if the app had more features..Very useful! I\\'ve been dreaming of an app that should let me know when the washing is complete! Great!.The notifications for my washer and dryer are very helpful. I no longer have wet wash sitting in the washer or dry clothes getting wrinkled in the dryer.very convenient especially if we are out and we wanted the house cooled when we get home..Very unintuitive and hard to use. Couldn\\'t connect my fridge or my washer.app sends messages when cycle is done. Also shows remaining time estimates..I have only used it once but it worked great and resolved a problem I had..Updated the rating - issues are fixed now. Thank you!!.Unusable. Keep erroring out during the registration phase..Superb app, many times i hv seen the error status alerted in app n informed ppl at home to correct the error in Washing.Great and easy to use. Loving our new washing machine even more!.SSID policy for characters is poor and prevents many from using your app..So many login options. None working. Waste of time..good app. keeps logging out. please fix it or tell me if i need to do something from my device....after update, app automatically starts bluetooth. kindly rectify the issue..Support? What support? Bought an OLED based on SmartThinQ ability which I\\'ve heard is not supported anymore. What\\'s the deal? The app in the TV isn\\'t able to be detected in the app..Too many unnecessary permission and need to login. I am perfectly fine without this app..Good but can be improved and made more user friendly with instructions.sometimes have a Wi-Fi instability error pop up but the app has been nothing but useful well done LG.I apparently can\\'t download settings to a washer and dryer without registering an account, allowing access to phone calls, and revealing my location? Helluva data gathering app....Great app. Reminds you when your laundry has finished!!.Good smart home app to check in with your appliances. Works with Google Home.easy to keep track of cycles and like the notifications when dishes are done.the connection with my LG doesnt work, there is no way stay connected on my wifi and on the washmachine at the same time....worst experience though i have two google accounts it\\' saying no account and when i created account within minutes it\\'s saying no id with such account tried number of times disgusting uninstalling right away.Works great. I didn\\'t realize how useful this function would be!.I have a new LG Wi-Fi dryer and I could not get this app to work. It was useless..Permissions to be removed (allow to use app and show appropriate warnings or errors, e.g. update failed, make sure your phone has enough free space, location is unknown, etc).easy to navigate and the instructions made it easy to communicate with my oven.excellent if you have a smart washer and dryer. remote start is a time saver.Too many permissions for an app to control my washer. Really strange..Audible diagnosis doesn\\'t work. Fails every time..Requires I give up phone permissions and personally identifiable information to control a refrigerator that I freaking own..Alerts on app are helpful since end of cycle tune isn\\'t very loud..The remote wash is cool. Now you can wash clothes even when you are outside..Still no sync with google home ..... That is why 3 stars.After update not able to connect my ac through wifi...getting no response from server...I\\'d like to try the app, but it gets to 31% downloading and stalls out, so that\\'s annoying..Nice app as it provides the features for different types of clothes cycle..Very Smart App... Complete Appliance diagnosis is just a click away.....easy to set up, no it doesn\\'t work with alexa i tried..used this for 10 days my fridgerator ended up at 46 degrees and couldn\\'t change it through app then reset then 2 days later it said my refrigerator was off i deleted the app.this is an awesome app. i found it very helpful in washing machine..With the app I can see progress of the washer thru the timer but I cannot make any changes thru the app..Has been very helpful in troubleshooting faults on my Washing machine.This application this not support LG\\'s top loaded washer model T1084WFES5A kindly fix it.Tales forever to connect to the air conditioner.Gives me remote diagnostic info and status of the refrigerator.Easy to use, controls the product(s) great..I was about to lose my mind and couldn\\'t figure out what was going on with my washer...but this app helped! Simple to use!.I bought this product so I can control it with my Wi-Fi from my smartphone now it only tells me I can use it if I allow LG to use my private information to sell to third parties! This is a rip-off if I hadn\\'t known this I wouldn\\'t have bought an LG air conditioner I give this a big 0 if I could on the stars now!.I LOVE this app. Definitely helpful in time crunches! Thanks LG.very useful i loved it but some issues are there regarding temperature setting.Tried to connect to Google home app but it says my country (USA) is not yet supported. when?.cant get anything to work right.. this must be a 3rd party working with LG - because it\\'s clearly not done correctly- waste of time but great marketing......wonderful time saver. diagnosed the problem right away. I love this app..very good app. can include notification when AC on/off.Wouldn\\'t let me log in connect to its website or use the smart diag which is the only reason I downloaded this invasive waste of time.can\\'t not add to Google home, it says Vietnam is not be supported event lot of LG devices are selling on our country..Good to use app Device can control remotely with the recent update because of some flaw bluetooth gets open.Just Ok, takes to long to update the status of washer/dryer when the app is opened..Unable to create a new account or sign in using Facebook, Google, or Amazon. Life isn\\'t so Good after all LG..Can\\'t connect to my fridge and washing machine, have sign connecting which go on like forever.Useless. Won\\'t connect to tag on devices following LG directions..can not use the app i continue to get a seever fail error when trying to open the app and then it force closes.Like the convenience and the trouble shooting portion was helpful..You can not connect the TV, as it is decsribed on the LG website..the program loads more time and doesnot work at all. cannot find anything.Great App! No more running down to check the washer!!.I can not connect to my machint.veryy helpfull while busy at home.nice but delay is pretty bad. cant use remote start feature yet.Since the update I can no longer communicate with the oven to set the recipes etc..LG has the WORST connectivity of all time! You are FORCED to open an account with LG in order to use any of the WiFi products you purchased, having to give up your contacts, and personal information. Then after you\\'ve promised your first born child for sacrifice, the product REFUSES to connect!! The program has so many glitches that its useless! After attempting 5-6 times to connect, following directions, it still says \"No product registered\" when you go to use it!!.this is not perfectly work and very very slow and also not working in Alexa and Google home.It won\\'t start... what this has to do with root devices... it\\'s sick to force people how to use their phones...useless app.I\\'m rewriting my review because I got the app to work. If you have a VPN, turn it off when setting up..amazing!!! loventhe convenience...remote start and updates!.I can\\'t connect it to my TV. Why? It should be so simple....would be useful to have alarm a minute or two before the end of the cycle.requires location and phone permission AND needs an account. I\\'m not giving lg my location,phone number and email address just for an app. Nice try lg but nope!.It a little bit slow.invasive, slow, and couldnt register my product. completely useless app..I tried to sign up through the app but always error is shown..Useless. No better than the manual. Error code diagnosis is the same in the paper format. I guess they would rather you pay for a tech. Corporate garbage..Fab.... Saves so much time when you have something wrong.please fix the loss of notification, reinstalling the app doesn\\'t solve it..I find it very useful for when I am doing the washing to be notified..doesnt run on rooted devices ( galaxy S5 klte SM-G900F, on Lineage OS 15.1 (Android 8.1).I wanted to install the app for my washing machine but they ask to many permissions that doesn\\'t look so necessary... TOO INTRUSIVE , deleted as soon as downloaded..app is not installing..it repeats the download several times.then the message come app is not installed......why????.I cant get a verification email sent to me I have resent over 50 times and checked my spam and trash and no luck.Super useful for minor issues that can be rectified at home.Unacceptable permission demands = instant uninstall. - I want to monitor my dishwasher. You don\\'t need my location for that. You definitely don\\'t need to make calls. - LG this is garbage. Smarten up!.Ever since latest update, it crashed immediately upon opening. PLEASE FIX.logged in to thinq on my phone, logged in on my tv, same account, and nothing works. How.excellent app but the requirement of drying and washing cycle may be brought together.easy to set up. nice apps to remotely control the stuff.Won\\'t sync with Google Home. Have you fallen out?.Its so cool to have my washer connected. Im notified when the cycle is done..The app keeps reminding me to add rinse aid to the dishwasher and there is no way to turn that notification off. Why? I don\\'t want to add it. I don\\'t need rinse aid, I don\\'t want to buy it and spill more chemicals in our water sources..I\\'ve only used it for about 1 hour, but so far everything looks good and it gives a lot of information I like..Why does your app need access to make phone calls on my device? So when I deny this you close the app... something is not right..This app help to solve 2 errors thus far. Both of which was my mistake..not used it. why does it need to be able to make phone calls? no way am I allowing this. Edit: Dropping to 1 star for a weak excuse to ask for permission to make phone calls.Will edit my review, as there is an issue with the app and it will be resolved. Thanks for the quick response..Very easy to use. Works well with LG washing machine.Could be easy to resume from app after water supply error ..great app, I\\'m able to check on my appliances whenever.Very helpful with diagnosis and use..Good app but there is always room for improvement..Gets work done but laggy interface. Changes should be done to UI of the app.glitches when connecting to appliance. frustrating to connect.after last update, app constantly crashes saying no connection..This is very helpful app for lg.The app does not work.Works as advertised. Shame it doesnt work on an Android app on Chrome OS.Did not help resolve the issue. Dishwasher is still broken and this mentioned that nothing is wrong with it.app don\\'t work with google assistant... ap p need tv with os 4.0 but lg don\\'t provide update for 2018 models... LG shame on you. I will buy other tv brand next time.Love this app, love knowing the finish time and love remote start.Seems to work alright. Could certainly use a nicer interface..great I love the remote start and phone notifications when the load has finished.Tag on was tricky, but once connected, the smart diagnosis was impressive and right on target..it does not allow me to continue without entering date of birth. its ridiculous. DOB for using a tv remote?.Loving the ap. Works great with my washing machine and TV. Think I might get some more product from LG now..excellent... however I prefer to have Wifi to all devices as default..almost useless for wash machine. spent 2 hours trying to connect it together.As a product owner the app is best. But, as a app reviewer this could use some interface changes..Always diagnoses correctly... just wish there were more options to download for washer.Don\\'t think the app needs the weather. Would be good if the product history was in date order descending.Keeps telling me my AC is registered in a different country, and to delete that account. Only have one account..After update this app removed current power taken by the ac which was the nice function to know real time power comsumption which i want back.a little laggy as it talks to the machines but a decent app so far.Useless app with intrusive & unnecessary permissions which are *required* to control a simple washing machine. LG should be ashamed of producing such rubbish & publically slammed for forcing users to provide all manner of permissions under the guise of so called *security* requirements..This is ridiculous, location, Facebook login and manage phone calls permitions for an electrical appliance????? Are you people serious? Uninstalled..Supper App.This app works well in 1207SWS washing machine.I am using Jio modem for wifi connection to washing machine..Dishwasher isn\\'t working but the app won\\'t say what is wrong..can\\'t download washer cycle to machine. Fails every time..This app is good and helpful. I am using this for my washing machine.Even push notifications is On it still does not notify..So far great app!.It\\'s ok. But i can\\'t pause it from the app. I can\\'t undestand what is the use to have it ????.This app is so useful but how to off ac led by this app i got all the options expect the led light off/ on options.used to work, now it always give me network setup failed.great app. love getting texts when cycle is finished.love it no more walking to see how much time is left..LG is anti-consumer rights apparently. My phone is rooted for privacy reasons and it looks like LG would rather we not know what their app is doing in the background or have the abilitly to stop it. Designing an app that you are DEPENDENT ON to setup an account to pair it to Alxea, an advertisee feature sounds like an FTC violation. Sony did a similar bait and switch on the PS3 and got sued for it. Contacting my local Electronic Freedom Foundation to look into setting up Class Action for this..love it tells me when cycles are complete.. no wet laundry left to stink.just bought, had it installed. tested wifi diagnostic. alls good so far. next post will be when it breaks..Totally helpful! LG never fails!.So useful! Replaces multiple remotes!.awesome app. product diagnosis function is super helpful.Worst app, cannot connect my AC.

So that it will be more interactive and interesting..Can\\'t run on a rooted device. :(.The diagnostic for NFC washing machines could be much more acurate.the apps keeps saying unable to connect to server..excellent app.. like the timer and notification alerts.Cannot really do anything. Have to get up to turn dishwasher on so i can use the app. For the oven you have to do some ritual opening the oven door turn knob to remote whats the point if to use the app i have to go to the appliance anyway.. waste of trchnology.It is not compatible with my lg dual inverter window air conditioner....worked well - nfc options straight forward....Works great with our dishwasher.ive got a login and can login on the website to see my product but this app wont let me login with the same details.love this app, never leave clothes molding in the washer again!.Crapy app that doesn\\'t execute all the time and has limited pre sets no customization.why to give acces on my location and make calls??? hell, NO way. uninstalled after first use. to bad :((.Wi?l not connect to new tv. Everything else connected perfectly.Great App. Makes diagnosis of washer super simple.it does work but difficult, glitchy and could be so more.Being a LG customer for 20 years,this is it! False advertising.Bought a LG \"Smart\" washer/dryer and is anything but. The thing HAS to be ON, which requires physical touch and hold another button for remote control,everytime.Also commands are weak. You cant tell it cycles you want,basically all you can do is ask if its on/running and how much time is left.LG have a true standby so that clears up most of the issues, then better commands.Otherwise, it will be Samsung all the way from now on..perfect tool for equipment use, support and care.Very slow to load, should have more info/features..always saying cant able to connect to server even app is not opening.very useful app for self diagnosis of the appliances....App does not operate my wall type air conditioner on a schedule..Easy to use. Difficult to connect to the internet.Will not run on a rooted device or if it *thinks* it\\'s a rooted device (but it\\'s not). Why?.I control my AC and TV with it, working pretty good..helped to examine problem immediately! connected to customer service all is goog. I highly recommend..Washer showed IE error and app told me the exact issue and problem sloved.Wifi option on the Refrigerator doesnt connect at all.Not work. Can\\'t sign in. \"Server Failed to Connect\".app does not connect to service or generates an execution error.how to Disable the Wifi icon in Ac..,after wifi disconection!!!.requires too many permissions that do not affect diagnostic..very comfort for using my ac with this app any where and any time..Disappointed this application never help me to reduce household work. Waste my time to keep try do triggered signal for app...Can\\'t turn the dryer on from the app..easy to use, informative, very efficient.Delay in notifications, can\\'t tell if you can set up appliances to work with more than 1 smart phone.It is very convenient application to maintenance my LG refrigerator..Cannot run on rooted device. What a joke.best app to control and diagnostic your refrigerator on your mobile...Not very useful. Does not always notify..unable to get alexa to work with this app get it sorted.If I could I would give a 0 star.I have a great Wi-Fi in my house.Never would connect phone to TV.I have a G8 and a ThinQ TV..Can not wakeup the tv.The worst application ever. always disconnected. Very Very Bad.Long registration process, app works perfect for me.Very Basic options are available to control the AC.I have an lg ac and this app works with that ac properly....????.Good start, better integration with Google Home would be even better..Permissions required are intrusive.worst app not able to connect the ac with app everytime its saying registration failed.I\\'d love to use this app but it won\\'t even start unless you give it permission to make phone calls, which i\\'d rather not do. oh well ?\\\\_(«Ä)_/?.Read the terms of service. You agree that they have full access to all media, photos, etc all royalty free. They basically take all of your personal information, and you agree to it!.After I updated the software I could not use it any more. I was asked a ridiculous number of questions of a personal nature..I can\\'t register my LG washer dryer, an email was auto sent by the App to LG and there is no response after that.Great, but a little limited in functionality.Only thing I can say is I wish you explain how to download the Cycles better..this app walks you through every step of the way... the diagnostic was on point!!.Bought a ThinQ tv in South Africa and when trying to connect it to Alexa it says isnt supported.Disappointing - only useful if washer develops a fault but no point having the app until then..Just received new washer and dryer with SmartThinQ and will not connect with the program on my phone. After 30 minutes on phone with customer support no help what so ever. Told me to send email to support. Waste of time!.it would be 5 stars if you could add amps control on the app for Middle East Artcool please add amp control on the app so we can control it remotely.It is functional, but seems like with a little effort could be better.Works as expected. Handy App.It needs UX enhancements.Works great as I expect from LG. Thanks!.requires unnecessary permissions, extensive use of personal info in privacy policy.I am not able to register my Front Load FHT1208SWW through this app and when i called customer care suggested me to have a router with lease line really disappointed with product and this company.Smart ThinQ app is quite good but have only basic features needs to be enhanced.Hard to setup. How do you get a password? Want to use less water with washer and set a small load rinse and spin.Spyware. Cannot even launch without spying on the customer..excellent product.. best washer and dryer I\\'ve ever owned. correctly diagnosed my issues and offered solutions.. perfectly. wow, just wow..Waste of time trying to install on a gas range. Don\\'t know why they need my birthday access to my phone access to my pictures for an app that doesn\\'t work.Junk!

Also let me know when the ice maker in the refrigerator was blocked..it is a good start, hopefully some more functionality will follow.Would like a tone or vibrate along with the push..new update for energy monitor is very bad please revert to the old one.My oven does not display since the last update, deleted and reinstalled the app....Very convenient no worries on when your clothes has stopped.would be great if you could see a dashboard of time remaining, type of wash, all good, etc....does what it says from the app but doesn\\'t connect to Google assistant says not available in your country.Wifi connectivity unreliable. This feature seems gimicky.Won\\'t work on rooted device. Boom. Uninstalled..I am not able to connect google home. it alwys saying check your internet connection.worked good, no problems yet. was just setting it up for future use. I am expecting some in the future..Unexpectedly well designed. Where are the parts to download my own choice of cycle?.Works great! Hoping for more updates/features..Good app for my washing machine.The app was great now it keeps crashing I can\\'t even open the app.I use it for our washer and dryer to notify me when they\\'re done but sometimes it doesn\\'t notify me.love it. nice to know when cycle is done..Not helping, cannot detect problem, but the washer doesn\\'t work....fantastic app easy to use and understand really like this app..really hard to get the aircon connected to apps not user friendly.The app design is mediocre and the latest update forces you to accept corporate tracking of your device usage...

I have tired to contact the software\\'s developer via email and LG direct but neither have responded to me soooooo u may be wasting your time with this app.great app that lets you know when loads are finished.It\\'s really annoying as I\\'m trying to set up an account but it won\\'t let me use any thing for an ID.Nice remote visibility of the washing machine..it keeps giving me a error saying I need to sign in how can I sign in if I can\\'t get to the sign in screen.Instant diagnosis. Problem easily resolved.This app is unnecessary, over-complicated, and broken..Can not connect LG account to Google home..always no response from the server!!!! poor app..I went to Guatemala to plant and harvest some coffee and it still didn\\'t finish loading when I came back.good that its moving towards IoT but what\\'s the point when i can\\'t remote start it and it auto shut down.can\\'t run on rooted device: asinine!.Dishwasher not working yet diagnosed as no problem found!.It will be better to add more functions for smart fridge.This app is not even supporting my google account to login..its showing server is not supporting this app. I will rate it -1.Great for notifications when Cycles are finished....Vary goop app for smart divace contectivity.great app my washing machine has connected successfully thanks a million.Hi!

I\\'m a tech professional and enthusiast. I\\'m not breaking any laws, defrauding any companies, or misusing any products. Root access isn\\'t any indication that I might be. Worst of all even if those things were true, it wouldn\\'t even be relevant to your product, so the only logical takeaway from you blocking root users is that you just don\\'t want our business. Well, congratulations, your wish is granted. I\\'m no longer a customer, and as a tech professional, I\\'ll stop recommending your products for institutional use..very poor app. virtually useless to control oled tv.This app works well and does exactly what it supposed to do.not responding in moto g5 pluse mobile.Requires phone permission.

Why should that prevent me from controlling my TV? @LG: They\\'re my own devices, shouldn\\'t I be the judge of my security? I don\\'t see the possible downside for LG.Poor Customer Service.In brief,I went to LG CS office in my city in Indonesia to repair my phone being fixed.Yet,they couldnt fix it.By then,I cancelled for the service&paid them.I got a regular call (not VoIP app) from CS LG Indonesia(14010) for my Mb Phone issues.She was servicing quite well by ph (14010) in the 1st several mins.In the contrary after several mins conversation,I heard she pretended to have very bad signal by playing some noisy Background&suddenly hung up the call.

Also, there is no regulation that requires LG to collect birthdates..My TV is less than a year old and now there\\'s a new OS that I can\\'t upgrade to?.Its helpful and fast.this is one of the worst apps on the market stay away from LG smart anything...the name is an oxymoron...there is nothing \"smart\" about their products.ice automatic melts sometimes.remote function limited.useless for me after giving LG too much personal info.I\\'m still new user.

If it is legal? I think its creepy. And rude to not be a family. Eh hmmm. Yes. Ex I am soeaking to you. Terrible. Bad intentions is all I can say. Is what it is..Slow to load.I can not figure out how to get fabric softer in my settings of cycles.pretty Cool and very useful.Refuses to work without nonsense spyware permissions. No, you don\\'t need my photos to manage my dishwasher! No, you don\\'t need to use my phone and make calls! Knock it off, creeps! LG will probably reply to this and state the permissions are \"required\" - this is an outright lie. Fix your app and stop blaming your users!!!.Asking for my location just so i can access my dishwasher. I never expected lg to spy on people with their appliances. Please change this or fire the person in charge of this idea. Cause anyone with half a brain knows you dont need a location or ability to make phone calls to connect to another device. This is the lasy lg i purchase until this is resolved. You sad sad company..I have sent a detailed email. Plesase check. I wrote following on 18 Oct 2018 but till today no one contacted me even not answered.it looks like you don\\'t want to improve your products that really can help the customers. Absolutely disappointed by your approach. I have to give 1 star as no provision to give you 0 star. There are many issues with this app. I suggest that one of the members of the team should talk to me to understand the issues better as I am also a software professional..very slow app.great app to diagnostic lg washers.Seems to be good.Good Smart Diagnosis works well..Worked as supposed to.very helpful apps.it veryyyyyyyyyy slowwwwwwwwww connecting.....It\\'s good app for my daily plane.Refuses to work on a rooted device..easy to used.Very please with the outcome!.No longer notifies me when wash is done.This is awesome.It works.

If you look at LGs response to consumer complaints, they dont apologize for lying to consumers and they continue to do so. They have made it clear the are not going to anything to compensate consumers for false advertising and bait and switch marketing..Invasive. Sends all traffic about a dishwasher through Amazon Web Services. Worse than that, fishes around on phone where LGE hss no business and refuses to run because of rooted phone. My phone, my rules! Had to hide root to operate. Cannot get full functionality of appliance without app. My phone is rooted to enhance MY security by controlling iptables network access rules. I won\\'t go naked for LG\\'s convenience..Good . But want more control through this app.Very very good.Easy to iinstall..Give up your privacy and share your details so you can see if your washing is done? If this is internet of things i dont want it. Its a motor and a pump. Uninstalled..Good for checking the computer.Its simply Awesome....!!.it is not dowloading very bad app.Still.unable to resolve my problem.This app doesn\\'t work.It seems helpful.app is worth it.Working well since the update.terrible doesn\\'t work at all.Very impressive app.Seems to be useful..Easy to use.Easy to use.Easy to use.did not tell me why my refrigerator is not working..Lg is junk.. 1year and Not working.Love our new LG washing machine.Works a treat.The most useless app I\\'ve ever downloaded, don\\'t bother.works great (once you figure it out).cool app, helpful..Not much function it can control..either I\\'m stupid, or over thinking the capabilities. how do I completely control my appliances from my phone?.to slow and no much information\\'s.Excellent ?? for first day.good app for lg web os tvs.Does not start..LG is the best.It was very helpfull.Nice app, thanks to LG.use full application.Does not work.Waste of time.Saves me time!.Very nice app.Worked for me.LG is smart.Excellent & Awesome.Can\\'t even set up account. Do you realize you almost have more 1 star ratings than anything else; you call yourself a technology company LG...

I paid for 2 LG brand new phones. Stylo and LG G6 both got tested IN STORE and even the sales people were astonished at it\\'s horrible performance. I can\\'t take it back since I already took 1 back and they only allow 1 return so I actually have waisted my money on this pos..for combo washer & dryer.I really like it.needs a better multiuser support.Works really good.Good so far.i can\\'t use smart diagnosis app my washing machine doesn\\'t have wifi.Privacy policy is in Chinese, English speaking people live in hong Kong to.Nothing , bt good.There is no way to add custom wash/dry programs!.. how good is something smart if i cant configure it to my own usage?.Great for lg products.Easy to use!.Like the notification on mobile that dryer is done.You don\\'t need the call permission to get my language preference. Edit: Just ask me for my country if that\\'s all you need. Calls permissions are a very invasive way to get country. GE doesn\\'t need it....Super but it not coming.Good and convenient..great experience. it really cleans my dirty whites. well pleased..Easybtp use and helpful app.Very good Application.very nice app.What company makes a washer dryer combo. That has no way to select a dry only option? Then make an app that won\\'t even let me make my own dry only program. Last LG product and it\\'s being sold.So far so good.L g washing mashing dd very good.very good App works well.very bad app. good point but bad app..update of completion is best.Refuses to run if you don\\'t give it permission to make phone calls..I don\\'t get the point of being able to start the washer from my phone if I still have to load it and go turn it on....you lie to your customers. I pay hundreds of euros difference for Wi-Fi on a washing machine and I can\\'t configurate it\\'s program within the app. how stupid is that?.Why do u need my location to start the app? deleting. i have paid full price for the washer/dryer and don\\'t see any reason for you to spy on me..To worst app.the expensive dishwasher is only 2 years old, and LG told me to hire a repairman to fix the thing. the reapirman costs almost what a new Amana would cost, but Im going back to GE products..I downloaded it for a washing machine.. I would like to have a few details about the programs of the machine.. how many hours for each one as an example.Solved My issue.very cool, but haven\\'t used it much yet.Tells me what the device is doing, but doesn\\'t let me control it..I love it because it tells me when the washer/dryer is done. Now I\\'m not a slave to my laundry..This app is working fine.not possible to install.Not going to create an account just to get the smart diagnosis..LG customer service is terrible the worst I\\'ve ever had.Location and Calling privileges for uploading washer programs? You guys are hilarious..doesn\\'t work. much like my refrigerator.Hard to work with the app.how to off led light in this app.great it works for my oven.Helped me find why my washer was not working properly..smart diagnosis alone is brilliant.Better ues good lg g6 life.how hard it is to add a simple washer to this app.Our laundry room is in the basement so we love the notifications when a load is finished..What are you doing? This app waste your time not recommended at all.Amazing IOT experience.It has been very helpful....thank you.great app by LG.Helping me to remember to clean out the trap on the dishwasher and allowing me to download 4 custom washing cycles. Soo gyud.9uy 99 olomouc minions.This App just saved me from having to call a dishwasher technician.App it is not intuitive enogh.Was easy to use....Too many permissions.I feel like I live in the future! So freaking cool how my washer and dryer tells me that the load is done!.temperature value is farenheit but unit shows ¡ÆC.Long time for wifi connection.sucks so does the washer and dryer!.No useful information from this app..Read very close to what they cad do to your phone.....app doesn\\'t work.I love my new machine and the SmartThinQ technology.

Very happy. I use the app for a washer dryer and tv. Compared to a previous Hoover washer dryer and their app (it was awful) I would never go back. I can ask it to do something and it just gets on with it. I would add though that they need to simplify the initial pairing to the app with the washer dryer. Harder than it needed to be. All fine since of course!.Update 2: emailed as suggested below, after a week one reply came, promptly responded to, and now nothing after another few weeks. Terrible customer service. Update: Verfication email came through aaprox 4 hours later, by which time the link did not work. Have attempted to resend now multiple times but no email coming through again - still 1 Star! Verification email does not come through. Attempted 4 times now, but can\\'t verify my new account so cannot use the app with my new LG gear.Finally the compatibility with Google is there! The bad point remain that only few useless parameters are available. I was expecting at least two real temperature (fridge and freezer) with display between selected and real. ON & OFF timing (Graph) of the compressor related to the ambient (local weather) would be also a good point to determine the influence of the selected temperature versus the consumption of the device..Previous issue with the app being unstable is fine. However, all I am able to do now is put in pre-set washer profiles as opposed to having any real control over how the washer runs. Tried to uninstall and reinstall, but it continuously forced my phone to restart. Couldn\\'t get the app open once. I miss your old laundry app..PERMISSIONS! Not only can I not put the setting in my dryer manually (for example theres no way for me to use ultra low and damp dry) but they make me download the app which apparently needs location information and to access my calls? The location settings have NOTHING to do with connecting bluetooth to the dryer and im not giving your app access to my phone and contacts. Theres ZERO reason for this. Their dish washers are also terrible. Its like they dont even try out their products beforehand.Connected quickly to my 2.4ghz router. Awesome features! Do worry about electronics mixed with appliances(more to repair), but off topic of the app itself..Permissions are a joke, I\\'m not giving you access to my calls just to determine whatever location I might be at. Disappointed.Love the app BUT everytime the app updates I have to re add the products. Ridiculous!!.This app is good but it severely needs to include the ability to easily reconnect your device to the internet in case it fails or you make a change. As it stands now, you would need to add it as though it\\'s a new device..No option to change the language. Application changed location based to Ukrainian although the phone language is English and requested several agreements in Ukrainian language. Can\\'t use the app like this..Washing machine is always disconnected from wifi. This is a known issue. Shame on LG.Your dryer doesn\\'t full DRY my clothing even if I have Max dry and Max tempture set. Your sensors and energy saving is seriously the problem..¬®¬ß¬à¬Ô¬à ¬Ò¬Ñ¬Ó¬ß¬à ¬ã¬Ö ¬ã¬Ó¬ì¬â¬Ù¬Ó¬Ñ ¬ã ¬Ü¬Ý¬Ú¬Þ¬Ñ¬ä¬Ú¬Ü¬Ñ. ¬£ ¬á¬à¬Õ¬Þ¬Ö¬ß¬ð ¬¤¬â¬Ñ¬æ¬Ú¬Ü ¬ß¬ñ¬Þ¬Ñ ¬Ó¬ì¬Ù¬Þ¬à¬Ø¬ß¬à¬ã¬ä ¬Ù¬Ñ ¬Ó¬ì¬Ó¬Ö¬Ø¬Õ¬Ñ¬ß¬Ö ¬ß¬Ñ ¬é¬Ñ¬ã, ¬Ü¬à¬Ö¬ä¬à ¬Ö ¬Þ¬ß¬à¬Ô¬à ¬á¬à-¬å¬Õ¬à¬Ò¬ß¬à..Tragedia.

Very easy to use and support is 100% helpful..Buen sistema para controlar equipos LG.Tenho a lava e seca vc2, mas o app n?o permite fazer nenhuma configura??o personalizada de ciclos de lavagem. Qual o ponto de ter um app para uso remoto, se preciso sempre estar na frente da m?quina para configurar os ciclos da forma que eu quero? Al?m disso, a m?quina se desliga ap?s cada ciclo e o app n?o liga o produto. Ou seja: se eu quiser combinar at? mesmo uma configura??o de lavagem pr? determinada pelo app e em seguida escolher para secar, tenho que ir at? a m?quina novamente e lig?-la..our washer works great with the app, dryer just decided to work sometimes with the app..Muy buena aplicaci?n, la recomiendo.Washer will not connect..nao consigo registrar a smartv.Pretty useless..Works!.Very helpful app. Ads the additional washing options.LG refrigerators are of good quality and their smart application is useful.Wow it\\'s working.Not working ..Clean coding..Control home appliances with mobile is a great experience..Grate app.Works well.sony xperia.Total Digital.Gud one.Great.

After habing sucessfully worked the whole time, I now can no longer connect my washer The UIX is still horrible. Also the app lacks major issues for washing machines: You can not program your own washing cycles! You can not modify existing washing cycles! You can not add tumble dry to a washingcycle or also manually add it after the cycle has been completed, as remote connection gets terminated! Real?y hoping by renaming it to ThinQ they also rethin\\'q\\'d the functions of the app..Connection drop outs since the upgrade. This use to work nicely with the climate control unit however since changing to Thinq it drops out after a day and wont connect again unless I uninstall/ reinstall it.Slowest app in my phone. But.. Really help me chill the room while I arrive at home. It\\'s ok. But need more improvement. 1. Like save timer off without have to set timer on only. 2. Show fan speed 1,2,3,4 and 5 3. Show temperature room more accurate 4. Better usage electric results 5. More speed on loading app. 6. Bluetooth turn off after close the app. Keep better team!.App installs but crashes when you try to open it - new phone and app works fine..Super aplicatie.

I purchased a new LG washer/dryer last week. The Dryer will connect, the washing machine won\\'t. I have tried repeatedly. I also contacted LG support a week ago and they didn\\'t bother to reply. If you are looking for a \"smart\" machine, don\\'t get an LG. Other than that, the washing machine works well but the app is useless..Unfathomable that a major international brand could produce such a horrible non-functional app.  Your developers do not know what they are doing.  Please hire a new team to fix this.  God knows you have the $$$ to do so..Horrible just horrible bought the washer and dryer and can\\'t even download any cycles like I\\'m suppose to be able can\\'t use all features that the washer and dryer say they have. if I had of known Would never have purchased the washer and dryer set customer service is horrible as well and now I\\'m stuck with a set that I can\\'t fully use. I\\'ve had April and it\\'s now Aug with no update to this app to make the features of my washer and dryer work so frustrated..Fa schiffo questa app, neanche si apre bene, s\\'impalla al login, per dirti che non riesce a communicare con il server LG, quando ci riesce dopo 2ore, s\\'impalla nella procedura di collegare una lavatrice da 800¢æ al wifi, non sono contento, LG fa schiffo 24ore dopo, ancora non riesco a collegare la lavatrice.Thank you for this update. Now the app works much better..Aplicatie este ok in general. Eu o folosesc cu o masina de spalat cu uscator. Pe durata programului de spalat/stoarcere, aplicatia iti spune cat timp mai dureaza ciclul de spalare+uscare. In momentul in care ajunge la programul de uscare, aplicatia nu mai afiseaza timpul estimativ pana la funalizarea ciclului, desi masina de spalat afiseaza pe displayul ei timpul ramas..¥È¥á ¥ç¥è¥å¥ë¥á ¥ê¥ô¥ê¥ë¥ï ¥å¥é¥ä¥é¥ê¥á ¥ã¥é¥á ¥ð¥ï¥ô¥ê¥á¥ì¥é¥ò¥á.Works well!.Dope!.I like it.It works.great application!.Super helpful!.Smart app!!.Great nice ??.It\\'s nice.Good Technology ????.Awesome!.??.Very useful.Works great.Nice app.Works great.Convinient app.Nice Helpful.Great app.Good App.Quick set.Excellent Experience.Good now.Inaccurate.Excellent ??.V.good ????.Love it...Nice.excellent.Love it.Good.Useful.Useful.Fabulous.Good.Good.Good.Good.Awesome.Excellent.Good.Good.Good.Good.Nice.Good.Excellent.Amazing.Great.Great.Good.Awesome.Good.Useful.Love it.Excellent.Brilliant.Good.Nice.Good.Update: Still doesn\\'t work and no matter how many emails I send to support they never get answered, Don\\'t waste your money buying this product After the latest update I can no longer log in to my air conditioner and I have no idea why.Crashing app doesn\\'t work.Works!!!.Ok..Da.Ok.excelente.Goid.i like it.Great app..Nice app.Quite handy.Nice app.Really good.Great app.Good.Great.Good.Great.Great.Love it.Perfect.Good.Good.Great.Doesn\\'t work! Force-closes every time it\\'s opened, before it performs any function that could be considered useful in any way, even though it recognises the appliance. Is LG just trying to harvest usage data for marketing purposes, or does this useless app do anything at all?!.Yyyy.Fantastic app.Totally amazing.Excellent ??.Excellent.Great.Great.After the recent update on last week. The app disconneted from ducted air conditioning. Attempted many times to connect, it doesn\\'t function. What is the use of spending more money to have wifi enabled device and not able to use it? This app getting poor on recent update, have written email as well but no response yet..Unnecessary permissions (access to phone calls, call logs, etc., is excessive). Doesn\\'t work on some of my devices (using \"tag on\" stops at 30%). Why do I need an account to use NFC with my washer and dryer? Requiring an account is ridiculous for a washer and dryer.

THANK YOU! Original rant: Requires intrusive information in order to save settings. \"May not connect\" (read: dialog says NO) to 5ghz wifi, may not connect to high speed 2.4ghz, will not connect to wifi at all if you use anything non alpha-numeric in the network name. At least the IR remote that came with the AC works..Esta bien en cuanto a notificaciones, pero me gustaria que se pudiera encender la lavasecadora desde la app y no ir a prender fisicamente el aparato y tener que poner la opcion inicio remoto..Not working i have spent 1.5 years out of 2 years to have wifi working still no luck.Love it!!.Ok.VG.Super.Ok.Excellent!.Good app...??.Helpful app.good tech.Very good.Very good.good stuff.Very effective.Nice.Good.Good.Excellent.Great.Excellent.Good.Great.Nice.Love it.Good.Good.Good.Good.Updated review. App is painfully slow, so slow that you can\\'t use with Google home because it thinks it\\'s unresponsive, this is unacceptable. Plus with the latest version fan speed no longer stays illuminated so you don\\'t know what settings it\\'s on and at the bottom where additional settings are it just has \"@AC_MAIN_WIND_MODE\" on the button. This is why I don\\'t purchase LG products anymore because their app is rubbish. I have deleted and reinstalled that many times I\\'ve lost count..Very slow \"Checking product status\" when the app is starting. You have to wait around 20 seconds to find the device to be able turn it on. NOTE: My internet is very fast and the devices are receiving excellent WiFi signal. Device: LG Air Conditioner.Garbage. On the rare occasion I can pair the app with the air conditioner, the connection only lasts a few hours. It then always tells me the AC is powered off, though it\\'s on. Then we start the fiasco all over again with reinstalling the app. Worse than useless. July 18 update: Was promised by LG rep (see below) that an update to fix these issues would be ready by the end of June... Never happened. Why am I not surprised?.Been using air conditioner for a year and it still constantly disconnects from strong wifi signal. App is so laggy that it is a nuisance to use..This APP is BROKEN!!!! Needs fixing ASAP the app before this update worked perfect!!! I will be calling LG for resolution!!! As of 6/2019 the previous issues with this app have been resolved and the app is running great now..Doesn\\'t work. Fails in a different way on 3 phones I\\'ve tried it on. My NFC works perfectly but won\\'t work with this app. Total garbage..Refuses to run on my rooted phone. Why?? This phone only comes rooted!  Everything else works, why not LG\\'s app?? UPDATE: LG apologizes but won\\'t fix. Meh. I got app working anyway using XPosed Framework and RootCloak module, so I guess we all win some. Now, will wait to see if this half-baked app will actually link with my LG product once it arrives tomorrow! If not, I\\'ll be sorry I even bought it!!  UPDATE: Still love my (manually operated) LG air conditioner, but HATE the fact that LQ refuses to fix this problem. They should warn potential customers BEFORE purchase that their smart app is hobbled in this way. Installing Magisk (and using its \"Hide\" feature) bought me some time, during which SmartThinq ran, but then the app again disabled itself. BOO!.?????

The AC still becomes unreachable by both Smart Thinq and Alexa the minute we power it down.Aside from my AC frequently going offline and having to register in the app, the app works. One thing I can\\'t understand is why the developers would direct you to update Android System Webview, when Android switched to Chrome in 2016. You can\\'t update that and you can\\'t enable it either..Useless, can\\'t connect, not user-friendly.

No response from the server. Try again later\" and it shuts down. And why is Bluetooth being turned on when launching the app? Previous review: App doesn\\'t work! It shuts down immediately by itself. I have to use it on my old phone. Seems LG only hires amateur developers. When are you going to update it for the newer Android phones?.Update 5/15/2019: I can connect now however I cannot download new programs to either my washer or dryer, times out and throws an error message. WM5000HVA and DLEX5000V units..Whats the point of having the App, if turning on remote start is done via a button on the washing machine itself? Everytime i need to remote start a cycle i have to turn on the remote start from the washing machine before using the app. Useless!.A fair bit of work is still required to make this easier to use.????? ??? .. ??? ?? ???? ?????? ?????????? ?? ?????.great app ????.works.bekar.working.¬Ñ¬Þ¬Ñ¬â.bed.good!.Great!.Good app.very nice.great app.great app.simply good.very useful.Excellent app.awesome apps.nice app.good app.best convienet.Great App.very good.Useful app.awesome app.very helpful.cool features.best......happy.good.fantastic.good.best.Smart.love.great.nice.Excellent.Satisfactory.good.awesome.good.good.great.nice.awesome.Good.excellent.nice.good .....My opinion hasn\\'t changed. Connected appliances that depend on manufacturer servers are still bullship. App requires login to some social media provider. This is fuqing bull. My appliance, my network, none of your fuqing business! On top of that, app responds with \"invalid request headers\" on log in. I hate you LG. I wish I bought whirlpool..Couldn\\'t get this to work with my a/c for ages.... WiFi would not connect. I found that WiFi password is lge12345. Now works well and can turn on before I get home! Sometimes aircon unit drops connection to WiFi, but a simple power down and restart fixes!.Was working great until the latest update a few days ago. Notifications no longer working. Checked all settings in app and phone, all set to notify. My phone is a Samsung S8..The app was running well until the update, this made the app reset \\neverything and the app stops the washing machine in the middle of washing \\nso washing has to be restarted. If the app is running well don\\'t update it, \\nleave it as it is..rough, very rough start to the software working properly. now it is working flawless. I won\\'t be updating again... :-).I receive notifications after reinstalling the app for a short period then notifications stop, again.

LG really needs to look at their testing. I am back to square 1 with this and it is really, really really annoying..the Wi-Fi icon on my refrigerator shows that it\\'s connected to a Internet source but through the app shows error Message to try again try I kept trying again It wouldn\\'t work So I cancel it but you could still see that my refrigerator is connected to the Internet I don\\'t know why the app is giving me h*** but LG you guys need to fix this and I think it\\'s because of the recent update Because I can\\'t edit my refrigerators seasonal settings because the app is malfunctioning..I will try this and see. good luck lg team. for sure you machines are robust and reliable but this application needs more attention from you.It\\'s better than it used to be, but still slow and buggy.Trabaja correctamente, necesita mejorar y a?adir otras funciones para manejar por calendario las funciones y apagado remoto de la misma..Radi sa perilicom rublja samo bi trebalo biti uklju?eno vi?e programa kao i pranje tenesica.tak to je dobra mrtka,jeste vetsi sracka nez ta jejich pracka,rejzaci zasrany.Merge e ok acum.worked great on dishwasher and fridge.Super!!!!.works well.not working.ofrece poco.???? ???????.super app.Works well.grear app.un believe.Bulls***!!.horrible..All good now..its great!.Excellent app!.nice app!!.perfecto.ÆíÇØ¿ä.Excelente.super.gud.Ok.super.ok.okay.like it.super.Wooow.ok.super.excelet.Ok.it works.thulla.yeh.smart app.neat!.good!.Nice!.Great!.love it!.amazing!.??.??.grateful... saving $$$.V good.so cool.good app.easy setup.Good app.useful information.really cool.working excellent.very good.works good.good app.Very Helpful.nice app.very helpful.Is great.good app.great product.Extremely Helpful.good choice.great app.amazing app.pretty quick.Superb Experience.somewhat useful.good app.work perfectly.Vry Useful.awesome app.good process.useful app.very good.nice app.good expiriance.Good App.helpful tech.great app.V good.helpfully software.Great reminder.cool app.Nice Product.bad.great..great..excellent.good.good.cool.splendid.good.good.nice.AWESOME.Good.great.Great.good.good.good.good.Good.good.good.awesome.great.nice.good.good.good.cool.good.great.good.good.good.good.good.good.cool.good.great.Excellent.awesome.good.nice.cool.good.wonderful.Helpfull.useful.useful.cool.awesome.nice.nice.superb.good.good.nice.Best.perfect.BEST.good.nice.easy.v.good.The app works fine, but.... I am using it for my dryer/washing machine an I am very disappointed with the wash+dry cycles available, also there is no useful description of the cycles. Edit 18.01.2019: There is still no improvement on the issues. Give me specifications on each cycle, give me a custom cycle..Haven\\'t tried this in a while, now works on OnePlus 5. Downloaded cycles to both washer and dryer. Disappointed I can\\'t create a custom cycle, I thought that was the whole point of the download option. Hope that\\'s something for the future. Location and call permissions need to be removed, no need for that on most models. Some of these other reviews are a joke, if your phone doesn\\'t have NFC that\\'s not LG\\'s fault, grow up..bahut achha alpp hai mere fridge me cooling nahi ho rahi thi maine smart dignosys open karke check kiya to pata laga ki fridge me gas nahi hai.No permite registrar el horno microondas NeoChef con smart Diagnosis.Aplikasi cukup bagus.

I was looking to add a wool cycle to my washing machine (you\\'d expect one, right?). No such luck and apparently no way to program my own..Doesn\\'t work on a rooted phone error. Nimrod\\'s that say we are wrong for saying it isn\\'t work on a rooted phone are dumb. How do they know how its working on our phones. Mine says \"won\\'t work on a rooted phone\" and my phone isn\\'t rooted. So there is clearly an error coding, morons. Stop saying its an end user issue when dev\\'s have gotten pretty lazy in the past decade. How much were you compensated to lie about quality of software?.4 months after being talked into believing LG now made quality, my smart fridge is error coding, the app was a pain and when was prompted to call an operator, they stated were sending a repair guy out,And they would be in touch. still waiting, it\\'s still not working, just leaking.While the initial version of the app couldn\\'t run at all on my phone, LG eventually shipped a working version of the app after about six weeks. This was really annoying because they intentionally broke the predecessor app, so features weren\\'t available in that time. The updated app (12/16/2016) still asks for way too many permissions, like access to my contacts list, and access to my SMS messages, and requires that you agree to a long and legalese-filled terms of use and privacy policy. Both the long list of permissions and the crazy legalese are completely unacceptable, so this app will not get to live on any phone of mine. 11/22/2018 app refuses to run without unreasonable permission requests. Washing machine control doesn\\'t need permission to send my photos to the manufacturer..Change the alerts to standard Android notifications! The alert popup takes  over the screen interrupting other apps even if do not disturb is enabled. There should be an option to use Android\\'s standard notification alerts that sit in the notification tray.  Funny how LG comments about valuing feedback, but does nothing to implement basic features. I\\'ve seen others comment  as well. Avoid LG products all together..Another update: If you have a pedestal washer, you have to press and hold the \"Warm Water\" button for Smart Diagnosis, not \"Tub Clean\" as directed by the app. Hopefully that helps another user. Previous review: A year later this app is still worse than the old one was for my LG washer. The old app had laundry stats, features, explanations of downloadable cycles. (Even the paper manual contains basic info on the standard cycles. Why wouldn\\'t you offer some explanation as to what a cycle actually does, not just what LG thinks it will be good for?). This app is missing necessary functions and information. It\\'s sparse. And just not up to par with other current apps for smart products. LG, why won\\'t you give this app the same functionality for washing machines as the old app had?.Keeping saying my AC isn\\'t connected or just stay in \"getting data\" status.... After Multiple link unlink, uninstall, install, it became stable after a day or two....Been several years and this app still sucks. Slow and unstable app. Randomly will connect some days. Do not buy an LG product to use this feature. It takes 5 minutes to load...5 minutes!.Good for programming my washing machine but Wrong and unnecessary permisions needed on android 6 like access to files and media making calls!! Also the programs is not updated at all and they are like the first day..Doesn\\'t work on Android 8.1/Pixel XL or Nexus 6P/Android 8.1. continually get failed execution errors and program won\\'t load. Still doesn\\'t work. pixel2xl/9.0..Issues connecting to mini split units.... errors are not helpful. Hoping time repairs these issues.The newest update now only takes 20 seconds to load. It does what it needs to do..La aplicacion hace lo que tiene que hacer. Avisa inicios y finalizacion de ciclos.

Plus, your appliances need to display their MAC address somewhere. My network is MAC filtered. An $800 washer and $1000 LG combo with touch controls rendered totally worthless of the expense! Great work LG! Why would I ever but another LG product?.Piece of garbage. The NFC Tag On feature does not work at all. The app randomly crashes (unrendered handlebars style templates). It\\'s a shame since the washer would be otherwise great..Won\\'t run on rooted devices. So glad I installed and tested this while the salesman at sears was entering all the info into his terminal for the my new $3k washer dryer combo. He wasn\\'t too happy when I told him I changed my mind. Sorry LG looks like you made my blacklist. BTW MASTERPASS will run on a rooted device with a simple warning, but your cheesy washing machine app won\\'t?.Cannot run on rooted device huh, then suck this 1* rating up reeeeeaaaaal good..Latest update made oven control non-functional.Pleas add more functions for the Tag on products.Useful app for LG ecosystem.Easy setup and very helpful.Permissions.Great product.Great app.Useless.Helpfully.Good.good.Great.Convenient.Easy to install on my Samsung Galaxy Grand phone. Easy to navigate the LG \\nApp & download software updates for my LG washer and dryer with Smart \\nThinQ. Just switch to NFC phone setting & tap on the \"cell phone\" icon on \\nwasher & dryer to connect. I added a \"small load\" cycle to my washer & \\nventing update to dryer. BTW, I see people complaining about the App\\'s \\npermissions, but they are reasonable and necessary - read 3rd qtr 2018 post \\nfrom LG. Thank you LG! I\\'m very happy..It works basically. I didn\\'t found it and this app can\\'t see it, MAC \\naddress should have been shown clearly on appliances (it\\'s necessary for \\nmac address filtered network for example). If that helps someone, I was \\nable to detect the AC MAC with nmcli on Linux with \"nmcli dev wifi list\" \\nand \"nmcli -f BSSID,ACTIVE dev wifi list\" commands. My main concern is that \\nI try to setup weekly reservations on AC with the app and it\\'s clear that \\nthe timing isn\\'t saved, refreshed and executed correctly with this app. The \\nconnection to appliance is slow however it\\'s not just an app related issue..I am running a non rooted Pixel 2 XL running Android 9.0 Pie. I cannot even \\nget it to start as it states \"Cannot run on rooted device\"... It doesn\\'t \\neven attempt to open. The development of this app is so bad it hurts to \\neven have to write a review. So pretty much I will do what I did last year \\nand disable the wifi on the fridge and live with it as a normal fridge. \\nGood luck with keeping up with Google APIs that have been out for months..Update 2018-07-09: Still doesn\\'t work after update 2018-06-29: already sent \\nthe details requested immediately after first response from LG and still \\ndoesn\\'t work and never got a response.. Can\\'t run on a rooted device. \\nExcept my One plus 3T isn\\'t root protected by default (submitted my details \\nas requested and still no change).LG seriously needs to revamp the user experience of this app. I\\'m not even talking about the appliances the app connects to. The app itself is amazingly unintuitive. Also, there is no reason for it to be over 70MB, and crash if you don\\'t give it all the permissions it wants. (Normal apps will work fine until you try to actually do something that requires that permission.).This app handles notifications in the worst way possible. It will pop up \\nover all other apps instead of just doing a simple normal Android \\nnotification. It also sends tips through this method that has nothing to do \\nwith the timer of the washer. Use normal Android notifications!.Network unstable message, getting data, rarely connects. Please fix it. It  used to work fine. I regret buying LG and will likely never buy LG again.  This could result in a mass lawsuit if not fixed. Many users have this  issue and support can\\'t fix it, blaming it on their own network.  Update:  Everything is working now after an update, thank you very much.  While the recommended fix of cycling power,  uninstall/reinstall, etc usually works, it did not this time.  We have multiple phones and multiple units and all were affected..Utter trash software. Requires totally unessasary permissions and \\nconnecting to 1 air conditioner is difficult enough let alone having a \\nstable enough connection to change the temperture. Connecting 2 air \\nconditioners? Even 2 different models? Forget it. Total and complete \\nfailure to provide any usable functionality. It angers me to no end that I \\npaid extra for my aircon units to have wifi functionality and it is \\ncompletely unusable. LG u need to fix this garbage that you are charging \\nextra for..Can\\'t connect to smart refrigerator. It\\'s a total zero. Router is about 10 feet from appliance so I know the connection is solid as it is with other devices all the way across the house. It appears to connect to the appliance SSID but does nothing after that. I think this one got loose before it was thoroughly tested..Smart Thinq app was difficult to use, because the instructions are not \\nentirely clear and there are many places where one could make an incorrect \\nentry. Almost gave up at one point, and would have given a much worse \\nreview. Once I was successful in pairing my device, the app communicated \\neasily with my new refrigerator and registered my product. I am happy with \\nit..LG accout. login every time... Why ?? Every time I log in to the account it \\nkeeps telling me wrong password.. I have to reset password every time I \\nopen Smart ThinQ and then I have to go through the process of setting up \\nconnection to a/c unit all over again... what a waste ....This is the worst, most counter intuitive app I\\'ve ever seen. All I wanted to do was set up my LG smart TV on Alexa. But first I have to download this stupid app, which gives the poorest instructions ever on how to connect the TV to the smart phone. 3 hours later, and I\\'m still lost.This app won\\'t connect. When I contacted LG support, I received an \\nautomated email asking for the same information I just sent them. Then they \\nasked me to rate their software. Here is your rating. I would give it 0 \\nstars, if possible. What a piece of junk!.It was a royal pain to set up our refrigerator. It is finally working but the one thing I really care about isn\\'t available. I can set the temperature, I can see how many times doors have been opened and how much power is being used. But I can\\'t see the current temperature! Why can\\'t I see the current temperature when I can do all these other things?.What\\'s the point? You have to physically turn on you washer or dryer the stand there holding the remote start button for 3 seconds. Then whats the point of the app? If you don\\'t hold the remote start you can\\'t connect to the machine. Why isn\\'t that enabled by default? Also, with Google home, you can\\'t pause washing or dryg. ? You can stop it, but hey, when you stop it, it turns the whole machine off and then you can\\'t connect to the machine anymore! So... Up the stairs to go power on the machine and start the whole wash or dry over again because it doesn\\'t pick up where it left off, nope, it starts all over again. Not all that smart if you ask me... What would be nice is a standby mode where you can still connect to and operate the machine even if it is off from the app. And for the love of God, enable pause with Google home!!! Everyone at some point leaves clothes in the dryer. Imagine being able to say, hey Google turn on the dryer for 20 mins just to fluff up your clothes or warm up a sweater... Now that\\'s smart thin q ing..Utter piece of garbage, listen to all the negative reviews and don\\'t bother! Won\\'t even connect via NFC, just counting to 100% and say registration error. Connection is clearly detected when in proximity with smart phone, but just won\\'t register the washer..Doesn\\'t seem to work on the pixel xl. The app just errors out after launch \\nand never works. I have also tries it on two other phones. Neither work. So \\nthree devices from two different companies don\\'t work with this app..Got it to connect to 2 ductless ac\\'s easily. Have fun control of units, ui \\nis easy. Dislike how it requires crazy permissions and how I cant set \\nschedules. Smartthinq should be able to automate you ac schedule, not just \\nbe a fancy remote. It came with a remote..Worked well for a few days, but mysteriously stopped working. Now I cannot connect to any of my AC units, it\\'s been 3 weeks now with no success..Cannot run on rooted device. Absurd. Is this banking app that root bothers  it? Yeah, I figured it\\'s security reasons, but what is this app capable off that such reasons are at play ? Cranking up your loundry rotating speed while you sleep ?.Application works great and would be a 5 star app but the unnecessary and \\ninvasive permissions are uncalled for. Apps with permissions like this need \\nto be blackballed to get the point across that users are uncomfortable with \\nthese practices. Engineer a better solution that does not require this data..Tried to use this on my LG Fiesta 2 and I could not sign into my LG account, though I\\'m signed in with the same email and password on my computer, and both my LG phone and LG dishwasher are registered with LG? The app kept telling me my password or email was wrong? I figured, LG phone, LG app, LG dishwasher, what could go wrong? Ended up just uninstalling the app. Updated 8/4/2018 - After being informed that I had to create yet another password for this LG app to work, and that my LG account password isn\\'t linked to the app, the app works fine with my dishwasher. There\\'s not a lot of use for this app with a dishwasher, it did tell me when my load was done, and it did work. I downloaded it mainly for possible future diagnosis of problems..Good report on device updates via phone. It reports status of wash (whether \\nwash, rinse, spin or dry, or error) as well as time remaining. Wish the app \\nallowed resetting of alarm. But otherwise quite helpful..Absolute piece of junk, totally useless and extremely buggy and slow. I swear to God I will never ever in my life buy any LG product again; even if it\\'s free I won\\'t bother. What a nightmare to own any LG product..Absolutely terrible app. It\\'s hard to work, bad interface for a mobile device. Accidentally turn my ac off all the time when I\\'m trying to pull up the tiny arrow to be able to change settings. Takes FOREVER to sync, almost impossible to do it on the train. Not able to create an AC schedule of varying temps (just turning it on and off). AC doesn\\'t work with Google home, can\\'t change temps. I REALLY regret buying this LG AC.Over the past hour, I\\'ve experienced a number of errors when attempting to \\nuse the app and add my washer and dryer to the list of devices. The first \\nerror is upon launching the app when a message pops up that says \"ERROR. \\nSmartThinQ app. Failed execution. Try again.\" I tried again a couple of \\ntimes over the next 15 minutes and eventually the app launched. Next, I had \\nto register an account. I chose to use my Google account to register as the \\noption was given. A few more errors, waiting patiently for 20 minutes or so \\nto get a connection to LG\\'s server, and I was able to get the the apps home \\nscreen. I then moved on to choosing a device and attempting to get my \\nwasher or dryer connected to the internet. After 5 attempts with no \\nfeedback from the app other than \"Connection Failed. Please try again.\", I \\ngave up. You win this time LG. TLDR: This app is riddled with errors upon \\nlaunching or using the app. Limited resources to troubleshoot the errors \\nare available online..It needs an NFC compatible phone to work. Which means the app for my new washer doesn\\'t work on either my nor my husband\\'s phone. Why can the printer we have and also the lightbulb company for the LED bulb we have figure out how to use an app for ANY phone, and a major company like LG can only work with some phones? Useless..Nice to get notifications when my wash is done, but app is too slow. It \\nwould be nice if the notification tells me of the dryer is finished our not \\nso I don\\'t have to pick up the wet clothes..Permissions suggested snooping and privacy violations are likely. No reason \\nto access my contacts and storage on startup to connect to a washing \\nmachine. From a mobile software developer, write better software LG..It suddenly requires full access to my phone in order to work at all. I am installing it and calling the authorities. DO NOT USE THIS APP. LG, you don\\'t need to access my phone to find my country. I will tell you. You don\\'t need access to my files to update. I decide if and when I update. You\\'re not fooling anyone with this attempted theft. Look at the latest reviews. I\\'m not the only former customer. I\\'ll never buy another LG product again. No TVs, monitors, kitchen appliances. I\\'m done with you..I love being able to see how much time is left on my washer and dryer \\nwithout going into the cellar to check. No more setting timers to remember \\nwhen to switch the laundry. Very easy to set up too..Used to be more useful. I can\\'t seem to find model numbers, a link to \\nmanuals, available accessories, etc. Really not much point to this for \\nsomeone without WiFi appliances. Am I missing something?.App was good in Oreo but I just had my Google Pixel Cal\\'s OS updated to \\nAndroid P \"Pie\" on Aug. 6th, 2018 and now your app no longer works. Please \\nupdate your app to work with Android Pie! I\\'m soon to have an LG Dishwasher \\nin addition to my LG Washer..[Edit - LG acknowledged and fixed the sign-up issue. Raised rating to reflect that.] Unable to sign up for account. It tells me the LG account could not be created due to minimum age requirement not met. I\\'m nearly 40 years old. This message comes no matter whether I choose LG, Google Facebook, or Amazon sign-in. I have a Pixel 2 and also tried my wife\\'s Pixel 1 to the same result..Very good app, nicely built. gave information of how many times it has been \\nwithout tub clean, for maintenance, and general tips to keep the appliance \\nin good condition, there are many other options to explore in this app will \\ncertainly do that.I try to install, but the software require to access my photos, but I deny \\nand can\\'t use app. I don\\'t feel comfortable to allow an app to access any \\ndata in my phone. So I never use the app. Never mind, the app is not \\nimportant..The app works well. Good job LG. My suggestion is over the color scale for \\nenergy usage. Can it have a numetical option for colorblind people? People \\ncomplain over nothing. Could the pernissions be used to data mine? Yes, but \\nthey explain the reason why they are used. Even then, not all are enabled. \\nEdit 6/7 it\\'s been 2 months. Still no numerical values or anything else for \\ncolorblind people. This makes the energy usage screen useless to me. I\\'ll \\nwait another few months before I update this to 1 star if a colorblind \\noption still isn\\'t added. If nothing else, let me pick what colors are used \\nfor the scale. The idea I sent of numerical values is the easiest but I\\'d \\nyou are adamant of sticking to colors, let us pick them..I mainly set up the app so I can know the wash load is finished. Im guilty \\nof washing clothes and forgetting about it. Pop up is great. Set up wasn\\'t \\nhard once I realized I wasnt pressing the right button on the washer for \\nwifi. Lol..App doesn\\'t work, asks for calling permissions (what\\'s up with that??) And \\ncannot even create an account I keep getting processing errors for \\neverything on my S8+..LG... If you want to be innovative and try things like this. Take the time \\nto fix the apps that allow us to make our lives easier. I tried to see if i \\nsimply could and the app is buggy. It wont open. Servers time out too \\noften. Please fix this. Id love to use it and use it properly..Seems to me the first feature you would want in an app monitoring a \\nrefrigerator is the temperature inside. The second would be an alert when \\nthe temperature rises. But you won\\'t find either of these features in this \\napp. Instead you get useless things like \"ice plus\" that makes extra ice \\nfor 24 hours... Pretty much useless... The diagnostic feature doesn\\'t ever \\nwork via WiFi... I will uninstall it..FABULOUS DARLING!! My front load LG smart washer is a dream! I have enjoyed \\nwashing in this well made washer for 5 years. I had an issue with the tub \\nnot draining after washing a heavy load of small sized washable rugs. I \\nhave the SmartThinQ app and along with the Smart Diagnosis function on the \\nsmart washer, I was able to repair my washer easily with the diagnosis from \\nthe app. Great app and washer so far!.After one year I can\\'t believe that Google home support for my country(Bulgaria) is not available, this is total nonsense. The last lg purchase for me, you abounded all your older products software!.Doesn\\'t work at all. I was able to add my dishwasher to the app via NFC, but beyond that, all the Tag On operations fail at 60% with a message that I should make sure the appliance is on (it is)..Please allow the optional permissions to be optional. Don\\'t require phone \\nuntil I want to make a call, don\\'t require GPS unless I want to connect to \\nWiFi. Updated the app to \"improve login\", but this is still an issue. Won\\'t \\nuse until it\\'s fixed..Application does not work. Claims that my device is rooted, but I am \\nrunning the stock Android for my Pixel 2. I do not understand why the \\nsoftware even cares about root, but this instantly devalues all of my LG \\nappliances..I have installed the app on my s9+ phone and i can see the temp of my lg fridge ,but no power usage or anything else. Surely it can do more than that?.Nothing mind blowing of course, but it is a functional, useful app for \\nkeeping track of appliances I use every day. In this age of connectivity, \\nit\\'s nice to be able to have even less ties to the kitchen and concentrate \\non other things in life..Some improvement to login shows with July 2018 update. Still needs quick \\none click shortcuts to set aircon regular preferences, etc. Every single \\noperation of the aircon takes forever, I just want to turn the heat up or \\ndown, I should not have to click this, wait 20 seconds, click that wait \\nanother 10 seconds just to see the temp up or down buttons which themselves \\nonly respond after a few seconds with each click. So annoying. Bas user \\ninterface design. And also still waiting for integration with Google home \\nin New Zealand. Other devices integrate, why not LG Earlier review... From \\nover a year ago... Aircon schedule function is not very helpful it only \\nworks for one on and off operation. I would like to schedule it to switch \\non and off daily. Recurring schedules. E.g. low heat on daily at 6pm, off \\ndaily at 11pm, etc..Can not connect to my OLED TV. They advertise Google Assistant but it \\ndoesn\\'t work. I will say connection with my washer and dryer does work and \\nis a nice feature. I will update my review once they fix the TV issue..Terrible all around. I wanted to get info from LG washer & drier via NFC. I \\ncould pair devices, but NFC download froze on dryer dl, requiring phone \\nreboot before NFC dl worked again. App usability is terrible (in one \\nscreen, android back button is disabled). NFC process is quirky even when \\nit works - very little user feedback, requires trial-and-error fiddling \\nwith phone position. App requires login (with birthday!?) & invasive \\npermissions just to open: does not allow selective permissions overrides. I \\nwasted 30 min of my life trying to download data from 2 appliances with \\nthis garbage app. Device manufactures like LG clearly have no idea what \\ngood software looks like. I love the appliances, but don\\'t expect any help \\nfrom this app..Great app, finally used it on my LG double door fridge and it did a hard \\nreset to pull it out of defrost mode. Went back to working, great deal..Yeaahhh Im not giving out permission to my location, photo library and \\nphone call management only to control a freaking washing machine. Sorry \\nguys this is a flop!.I got it to work but their instructions are outdated for newer Android \\ndevices. For instance, I\\'m on Android Pie and the setting to turn off \\nmobile network switch does not exist anymore. Also I got kind of lucky. At \\nfirst it didn\\'t work and I was frustrated but then it occurred to me that I \\ncould replicate turning off this switch by just turning off my Cellular \\ndata. Not airplane mode but just turning off cellular data and it worked \\nlike a charm. Hopefully this helps those who are having issues. The problem \\nis that your phone switches from the device it\\'s connected to and it wants \\nto connect back to your WiFi and link it there but what it does if you \\ndon\\'t turn off your cellular data is it connects to the internet there and \\nit looks for your device but it\\'s not going to find it on your cell network \\nhaha. This could probably be fixed by LG by checking the data connection is \\nWiFi instead of what appears to be just scan as soon as you have data..It was the first time when I tried to connect my topload washer with it but \\nafter 30+ tries the app is not showing the WiFi networks of washer and my \\nrouter both. It is not easy to connect as the app doesn\\'t allow us to. I \\nhope with some new update this bug will let us use the feature otherwise \\nthere is no use of such features and should stop charging for the \\nparticulars from customers.Quick and easy connection to my phone. Just follow the prompts in the app and tag the NFC spot. App is simple enough to not overwhelm with useless options but is a nice companion to our new dishwasher..While it does do what it says, it does so incredibly slow. It takes an \\nunnecessary amount of time to connect to the units on the network.Doesn\\'t work. Support line emailed me the most retarded instructions ever. \\nI never messaged them back. Truly trash..Trash. Not sure what LG is doing. Doesn\\'t connect well, won\\'t download \\nwasher or dryer \"features\", so there is truth to the customer rating. \\nShould have gone with Samsung. Gave 2 stars because I\\'m holding on to hope. \\nComplaining on social media next..The app provides the same information as the on-fridge dashboard. It \\nprovides the temperature settings but not the true measured temp. The \\ndiagnostics is essentially useless outside of monitoring door open \\nstatistics..Failed execution upon first launch. Pixel 2 XL with Android Pie. Fully updated..Tried to use app with our washer and dryer for the NFC tag on feature but it just does nothing when trying to register. Never had an issue with other NFC objects so it is an LG issue. Troubleshooting info is worthless..Does not work. I have an LG refrigerator with Wi-Fi connection. Can get the app to register the refrigerator, but then it fails to connect. Tried a dozen times. I\\'m a software engineer, l know how to connect devices to networks, but the connection process is too complicated, error prone and at the end of the day it just doesn\\'t work for my refrigerator model even if every step is done properly. Update: after trying many more times I was successful. It seems this app has a race condition or timing issues. You often get different results or different errors for each attempt to connect, it isn\\'t consistent but if you are persistent it finally connects, very frustrating. After all that trouble though the app itself isn\\'t very useful. It\\'s too tedious to enter all your food all the time for that function. The best feature is the alert if your fridge temperature gets too warm. But its a whole lot of trouble for not much benefit. Another update to this review, since the latest app version as of December 2018 this app doesn\\'t work at all, can\\'t connect to my refrigerator, complains that my refrigerator is turned off. It\\'s a fridge dumbasses, if it were off my food would spoil. Deleted the device and tried the setup process again but this app now doesn\\'t even see my fridge, less than worthless, deleting....Did nothing. Told me that there were no problems detected even though my 2 year old nearly & $3k refrigerator won\\'t cool..Very nice app, gives you information if there\\'s any trouble with the \\nproduct, and information if you\\'ve neglected the maintenance of it as well. \\nI did have some difficulty in using the connection to the dryer and have \\nfailed to be able to diagnose it,but the washing machine and the app work \\nperfectly together.The app does not open anymore. It was pretty useless, so its not a huge loss. Do not buy LG products with SmartThinQ technology because it doesn\\'t work. In fact, don\\'t buy any LG products at all..This app is trash. Unlike the old lg app, you can\\'t even use this one without both giving them unnecessary permissions and signing in with a social media account so that they can siphon off as much information about you as they can. If you try to create an LG account as an alternative, they want your DOB -- right cause they really NEED that. No matter what date you give them however, the apps says the minimum age requirement is not met. So to me that says they are blocking new accounts and will only accept a FB/Google/Amazon account. Not gonna happen. All I wanted was to diagnose my LG dishwasher that isn\\'t working and has been troublesome since day one. Never again will I buy an LG appliance..Does not connect with the Ac unit.. total waste of time bought this unit \\njust because of this feature I wish I checked these review before my \\npurchase ... useless app.Installed on Pixel 2XL, app fails after getting permissions granted. Tried \\nmultiple times never got app to successfully start. Bug!.No notifications since last update. Using a Non-rooted Pixel 2XL on Android Pie. App used to work ok (Though it should use Android notifications rather than splash screen notifications) I\\'m using for an LG Washer/ Drier combi (There\\'s no option to set this up as such, you have to set it up as a Front load Washer only). The UI is a bit janky and the notifications are now unreliable. At least you can set remote start from the app (For some reason only set programs, not adjust things like spin or temp) but you get the feeling this will likely break at some point too. Not enough focus from LG on the app. The Washer Drier itself is superb, however..Fails every time to register product and all steps are completed. Update- \\nstill doesn\\'t work and never has. Utter Garbage.I shouldn\\'t have to log into an LG account to use this, in my opinion. I \\ndon\\'t want to create yet another account, I just want to interact with my \\nappliance. Way too intrusive..Can\\'t get it up and running. After dealing with all the permissions it \\ndidn\\'t recognize the washer I had registered on lgusa. No value added as \\nfar as I\\'m concerned..Probably the worst app I\\'ve ever used...every update made it worse than the \\nprevious version! I shouldn\\'t be surprised cause LG is well known for their \\nshallow customer service standards and their tricks to grub your $ and then \\nforget their promises. Instead of making this app work as promised for \\nexample download a cycle to their washing machine fast and efficiently, the \\napp will show you the weather, right?-like you need to know the weather \\nfrom their app!...please, but this is how they can justify the location \\npermission required to run the app, not to mention the rest of the required \\npermissions or that now you need to log in with your email account to be \\nallowed to use the app which more times than accepted, it will hang or \\ncrash or it will take forever to start...If I only knew before my \\npurchase...no worries LG now I do!.waste of time. i dont need my LG products to search my photos, manage phone \\ncalls etc. i need to download a cycle on my washing machine. massive flop.I tried for 3 hours to get my new air conditioner connected and was \\nunsuccessful. I am good with IT and networking but this app is just plain \\ngarbage. I even called tech support and the representative was clueless. He \\ntried to tell me that my android phone needed to be running a certain \\nminimum version of IOS... He then proceeded to tell mto do all the steps \\nthat the app walks you through. I saw that some people had luck with the \\nprevious versions of the app so I went and found the .apk for a version \\nfrom last year. Guess what? The app tells you an update is available and \\nwhen you choose not to update, IT CLOSES! You can\\'t even run an older \\nversion if you wanted to! I didn\\'t buy the AC unit for the bells and \\nwhistles, but it would be nice if they actually worked as advertised. Also, \\nno way the app should need that many permissions. **Update 05/24/2018 - \\nZero response to the email I sent to the developers as requested. The \\nupdate pushed out yesterday has had no effect despite claiming \"bug fixes\". \\nStill garbage. 7/14/18 - the app barely functioned as intended after the \\nlast update. The update on 7/8 completely broke it again. Also, the \\nscheduling is pretty useless if you can only set on or off. How about an \\noption to change temperatures at a specific time?.Very glitchy app. Got it to tag my washer, but won\\'t stay on for \\ndiagnostics and won\\'t register washer. Maybe not use NFC?.I just purchased a new LG Washing machine after going to Consumer Reports and checking out which were listed as the best in 2018. Part of what attracted me to the washer was the LG SmartThinQ that would hook up to my android phone and give me some reminders that I can use i.e.; a load is in the washer to put it in the dryer, a load is in the dryer take it out, yes I purchased a paired dryer but it has not been delivered yet. Well I can\\'t get my Samsung Galaxy 9+ to work with the washer. I tried everything. I installed and uninstalled it to see if I could log in using my LG Account it would show I had registered my Washer.  It told me I was using a Google acct and I had to log in that way. I tried logging in using Amazon and the device kept trying to download some sort of information that never finished. I had to get out of it to make it stop. So long story short. I have a washer that the program will not work with and am extremely disappointed. Comments were unavailable via my cell phone so I am commenting using my laptop. Assistance to get these to function together. By the way I did try NFC and pay is the way it is listed in the new Samsung phone so that was useless..Unable to use the app without giving it access to my photos and location \\nand allowing it too make and receive calls. None of this is necessary to \\nlink to a fridge freezer. What are they up to? It can\\'t be innocent!.Doesn\\'t worth 3/4 of the time, the other 1/4 of the time it only partially \\nworks. The customer support site does not work..No matter what age I use for account creation it tells me minimum age not \\nmet... Really, when I tried 1909 I was too young.App doesn\\'t load. Error message saying \"Cannot run on a rooted device\". My \\nbrand new LG G7 ThinQ phone is not rooted..Doesn\\'t even run on rooted devices. Refrigerator being returned. Good \\nchoices lg. . ... Morons.It doesn\\'t support latest top loading washing machine model T1084WFES5A and \\nerror is shown as \"This product is not supported\".Odd apps permissions needed. This is a smart manager for home appliance - \\nno reason to ask for permission manage my phone call. Also no reason to ask \\nme to sign up to even look at the app features - I can\\'t connect to my HOME \\nappliance that I paid for because you needed an online account? Really?.The app launches and works fine for me (Pixel XL which some people seem to \\nreport problems with but I\\'ve never had it FC even once) worked fine with \\nmy washing machine for 1 month, then it stopped sending the cycle end \\nnotification. Odd, it still sends notifications for other things if e.g. \\nyou haven\\'t closed door properly. And I can see status whilst running. But \\nno cycle end notification any more, and there is no info on \\'last wash \\ncycle\\' either or on number of cycles either since it stopped sending the \\nend of cycle notification. I\\'ve tried removing device from app and \\nre-adding it, but behaviour remained the same. I think it is on machine \\nside (or LG centrally) that notifications aren\\'t being sent as it stopped \\nat the same time on my wife\\'s iPhone. Would be nice to get the \\nnotifications back...! Update July 2018, behaviour remains the same, still \\nno notifications for cycle end and no historical cycle data. Reinstall \\nmakes no difference..Waste of my time. Won\\'t connect to appliance and now I will uninstall. It \\nsays have the machine near the router. Why would my washing machine be by \\nmy router?.Worked for a short time; 1 day. Wi-Fi shows refrigerator off or \\ndisconnected. No longer connects..a throughly irritating app. asks for your google ID or FB then appears to want you to redefine it. was this coded by amateurs or novices? frankly I wouldn\\'t trust its security.App does indeed need crazy permissions to run. When denied the app \\ncloses... soooo uninstalled.Ive installed and reinstalled several times and apparently be 34 years old isnt old enough to operate a washer. Every time i try to create an account it tells me that im not old enough. Minimal age requirement not met!!! What the hell Lg?.We need button just click and go always click on 4dot go back ,again click four button ,we want full custom program like ,10 minutes wash ,12 minutes steam ,15minuts dry or like any other combination ,don\\'t give know give tuch scree button ,even power and start button ,or power button must be on top ,children keep playing with that,.Aug 29 - 2018 Hello,  I was promised 16 days ago that the engineering team would contact me as your customer support spent 1-1/2 hrs trying to get my Smart ThinQ app to register my new LG Washer and dryer.  I received server errors as well as could not register, try again.  Same thing happened with the washer AND dryer with the wifi on the washer and dryer AND I did switch my app to use the washer or dryer network when I was  supposed to do that.  We tried 20 or 25 times.  I never received the promised contact from the engineering dept.  I called again on Aug 17 and Shan and she also spent more than 90 minutes and could NOT get my app to register my washer and dryer.   She told me no worries, she spoke with a supervisor and I would definitely be called tomorrow on the 18th by a supervisor. I NEVER was and now another 11 days has passed.  I want to return the washer and dryer to sears before my 30 day exchange privilege ends.  Today, Aug 29 your rep Joy told me to send this complaint and you would respond SHORTLY.  Please, I need to hear from you today.  Thank you.  I posted as you requested last week and no reply same with your Smarthinq email team.This app is usless even if it worked. Nothing useful. And doesn\\'t work as described. LG Should either get rid of this app or fix it. This is very bad advertising for LG. It tells me they are either inept or don\\'t care about customers..Just registered my washing machine. Try to use the app and tell me that ID or password are incorrect... Seriously used the same password I wrote it down and cannot use the app... Fix it please.I have an LG-LMXS30796S refrigerator. Manage to connect. First issue: When it starts it shows that my fridge temperature is 35 C and the freezer is -1 C (which of course is not true).When I click on it shows 35 F and -1 F which is more likely, but there is no way to change from Fahrenheit to Celsius (I did not find any). I am in Canada and I need Celsius , this is how the fridge is set to show the temperature on the front panel. Fahrenheit has no meaning to me.  So how do I switch the units ? It\\'s a fridge , so this is basic stuff. I tried every settings I found in app, no use.  Second problem, the app works only when I am at home. If I try to connect from work it crashes at start. I know, this could also be some weird setting on my work WIFI but on the other hand all other apps I use do not have problems, so again, why this one ? Is this a \"feature\" you only can access it at home ? Anyway this is not so major for me, but the temperature units is..What a terrible app. I keep getting error messages. I couldn\\'t even set the account up. Tried uninstalling, reinstalling. Just terrible..So glad i installed the app before buying a $200 piece of useless hardware. App doesnt work on \"rooted\" devices making the wifi adapter pointless..What\\'s smart thinq standfor? Why can\\'t we do the manual program of what we \\nwant the washing machine do for us. 3 hours for clean just 5 pairs of \\nsocks? Work great on SONY Experia XZ2 by the way..If your trying to use this to connect your dishwasher then forget it. IT doesnt work..Works great, but please please please LG, can we have a spin only cycle for \\nthe FH4U2VDN1 or give us the ability to edit cycles..This Aap doesn\\'t work in rooted phones and not available in ios therefore \\nwe can\\'t use our smart washing machine wifi feature..Tag On part takes for ever. My arm is falling off. Held it for 10 mins and it finally worked on the dryer. The washer never even registered....Wheather information is not displayed, even if the app has location access \\nand even if I choose the location manually. It\\'s always stuck on provide \\nlocation information.The app is useful and works well, if you know how to install and use it. Only one thing is missing, LG instructions how to install it properly..Horrible app very slow...and very buggy.. This has to be a beta app..too buggy the be finished product. Can\\'t input temperature in reservation part of app ....only turns on and off unit..NFC tag on does not work which makes this feature worthless. Tried with multiple phones and the troubleshooting info is so general it is worthless as well.I dont love it when my washer comes up with an error message but I love the \\nfact I can use this app to find out what\\'s wrong with it each time it\\'s \\nonly taken seconds to sort out.App doesn\\'t even open to do anything. Failed execution every time..Downloading the program information... please wait tens of minitues and reinstalled it, i spent more money for a fridge with wifi and i cant use it.Doesn\\'t work on rooted devices, thing is my phone us NOT rooted. FAIL!!!.Original Pixel phone, running Android 9.0. This app refuses to start. I\\'ve tried clearing the cache, local data, and forcing it to stop..too many permissions. scared me out of finishing set up..Junk that doesn\\'t work just like the LG refrigerator that I paid for that doesn\\'t work. I will certainly never buy LG again after this..I don\\'t see this App serve any purpose. Could be much better if the specific program allow user to change some of the settings i.e durations, temp and so forth..Invades my privacy. Wants access to stuff it doesn\\'t need to!.Asks for ridiculous permissions. They say why, but the reasons are also \\nridiculous.Refrigerator just got repaired still not cooling and the app does not detect a problem still. Its useless..Wont connect to my refrigerator. Tried for a hour and now deleting the app. \\nIt also is very poor giving instructions as I had to visit YouTube..I love the app works really well for my ac even when I\\'m not home I can \\nturn it on at any time and change the ac temp really love it keep it up lg \\nand I might fully switch to lg prouducts.Would have liked to use this app with my new front loader but it only uses \\nnfc network which my phone doesnt have.I am over 50, can\\'t creat an account because I don\\'t meet the age \\nrequirements. Am I to old to use this app? Lol.I HATE MY WASHING MACHINE! WISHING I HAD MY EXPLODING SAMSUNG BACK! IT\\'S JUNK.Unable to login using Google ID. Asks me to sign up after selecting sign up \\nusing Google. Fix this!.In all my years, this is the most useless thing I\\'ve ever downloaded.Garbage! Can\\'t run on a rooted decide, but mine is not!.Liked the app now asking for me to accept data being transferred out of EEA \\nand wants excessive access to data. All i want is the washing machine \\nprogrammes I had before the update..This App didn\\'t work when I first bought my knock knock fridge freezer but \\nnow works perfectly. Glad time has been invested to fix the bugs!!.Worked on my previous phone. Switched to Note8 and it doesn\\'t work at all.App wanted to manage phone calls to be able to access call centre. No thank \\nyou. App deleted before use..Helped us pinpoint a defect in our NEW just delivered refrigerator..The diagnostics seem to work. I hope I would not need to use it..Tried to use it. The app won\\'t run on rooted devices. What is so special \\nabout it?.It works well even when I\\'m away from home and using crappy phone.....App is sooooooo slow. NFC will not detect via phone..Terrible apps. Can\\'t even log in..Doesn\\'t recognize my washing machine so useless..I refuse to comment on this junk software..Slow and doesn\\'t work most of the time..I tried to open the app and it said \"Cannot run on a rooted device.\" 1. My device was formerly rooted but it isn\\'t rooted now. 2. There\\'s no reason to make an app refuse to run on a rooted device..Aplikacja uruchamia si? ok 1,5minuty. Od momentu startu do momentu kiedy da \\nsi? co? zrobi? mija wieczno??. Co chwila jakie? b©©?dy. MASAKRA..Unable to sign up. And tracks location. For what?.Very easy to use. Awesome capability and functionality to compliment the \\nappliances connected. Makes the whole smart home experience easy and \\nsimple. Love LG and the consumer friendly innovations..Doesn\\'t run on a rooted device. Unusable..Stopped working and can\\'t reconnect to network.Says it won\\'t run on rooted devices, but my device isn\\'t rooted... Google \\nPixel unlocked bootloader...All controls and options are contained in the air conditioning app, even \\ndirectional control. Can control AC remotely and have to cool before \\narrival. Awesome..Requires too many permissions and too many personal details even just to \\nsee what it could do..App won\\'t even load because it won\\'t run on rooted phones. But my phone \\ndefinitely is not rooted..It\\'s difficult to connect it to washing machine via wifi, also the remote \\ncontrol option always needed to turn on to be able to control it.\"Cannot run on rooted device\" I should decide what I can and can not run on \\nmy device. Not a company..very poor app, it doesn\\'t work for smart diagnosis..I got this app for my new air conditioning unit. It works great, I can operate the unit from my phone, it gives me readings of the temperature in the room. It was easy to install, easy to connect to my account unit and easy to use..Not that smart... And not really helpful..I am deleting this application because I fill it should show me how much time is left on my washer and dryer and it does not.Love being able to see how much the fridge is opened, energy used, and \\ngrocery dates function. Everything about the fridge and app is great!.It keeps on failing to start up.After installing and click Open, it inform me \"cannot run on rooted device\". My LG V20 is not rooted!.permission hog for no valid reason.The diagnosis does not work..App worked perfectly fine for me. I was able to download the Nightly Cycle for my dishwasher. Now going to add my stove to the app..Not working on pixel XL 2 Android 9 ver. \" Cannot run a rooted device\" my device is not rooted ??.I hated it soooooo much!.Doesn\\'t work on rooted devices.Worthless. Sign in fails. Intrusive permissions..The App needs to be enhanced and updated to be more efficient in connecting \\nwith the appliances..¬©¬Ñ¬á¬â¬Ñ¬ê¬Ú¬Ó¬Ñ¬Ö¬ä ¬â¬Ñ¬Ù¬â¬Ö¬ê¬Ö¬ß¬Ú¬Ö ¬ß¬Ñ ¬Ù¬Ó¬à¬ß¬Ü¬Ú. ¬¯¬Ö ¬â¬Ñ¬Ò¬à¬ä¬Ñ¬Ö¬ä, ¬á¬à¬Ü¬Ñ ¬ß¬Ö ¬â¬Ñ¬Ù¬â¬Ö¬ê¬Ú¬ä¬î.So far so good! I have used the Smart Dx tool and it has been pretty easy..Good app. Could improve the speed and response time. I think takes to much \\ntime loading product info and logging process..The app was unable to determine the problem with my dryer using the smart diagnosis tool..It\\'s difficult but happen.Wouldn\\'t let me sign in because the minimum age requirement was not might. No age selection satisfies this minimum age requirement..I can\\'t even sign into my LG account in order to use the app..Good app to diagnose the problem associated with displayed error code..In useful app just waste your time.Superb Smart App. Pretty useful for people who live in AC environment \\nwithout prior knowledge to control..Signed up to lg account and never received a confirmation email.After the last update I can\\'t connect to WiFi..Does the job for LG refrigerator.Used it for stats only. Have not had to use it for troubleshooting yrt.Requires too much access to my personal information.Very Helpful detecting problem of my front load washer.It works well with my s8 samsung and the washer and dryer.Works well though descriptions need to be a little more simplefied.It is wonderful to know when the laundry is done. The Smart Diagnostics helps a lot too!.Good app but please add programs for simple tasks, like only spin or only rising.No response from server!?

It was so \\neasy and took only a couple minutes to create a new account and register my \\nunit. I wish my washer had Wi-Fi but the NFC functions are a nice bonus to \\nbe able to download wash cycles and keep track of the tub cleaning \\nschedule. The NFC did not connect with my phone in the case even though I \\nhave no problem using NFC with my phone in the case for other things. Might \\nbe the popsocket on the back and not the case itself. Not too much of an \\ninconvenience though. Love my new washer and the app..Im using a new lg phone and a brand spanking new lg washer i need the tag \\non to wash clothes that are waterproof...come to find out my new lg phone \\nis not supported for this app so now i cant wash my babies sheets. Fix this \\nissue lg and quick i spent alot of money on your washer dryer and phone \\nmake them work together. Not a happy customer.I\\'m very surprised and disappointed that LG would publish an app without \\nexhaustive testing against all the platforms it is intended to support. I \\ncannot add an appliance because it fails to recognize that my phone does \\nallow Near Field Communication. Sad that LG could not devote sufficient \\nbudget to the effort after making it a prominent feature on these product \\nlines. What a horrible thing for their reputation..App requires permissions for possible features I don\\'t need. App doesn\\'t \\nwork without granting those permissions. This is a BAD and undesirable \\ndevelopment strategy, invasive permissions should be OPTIONAL. And yes, LG \\n*says* they respect your privacy, but even when they are sincere, there is \\nNO guarantee they can prevent a possible data leak et cetera. Therefore, \\npermissions such as these should be optional..Does not work. I have an LG a/c unit and it won\\'t connect, I have restarted \\neverything (unit, phone, modem) and uninstalled/reinstalled. When I used my \\nunit last year with the same phone it worked no problems, don\\'t know what \\nhappened but I am highly disappointed that I paid the extra money for wi-fi \\non my a/c just to not have it work..Really? Way way too many invasive permissions. I would like to read about \\nexactly why they need access to some of them... record audio via \\nmicrophone? Read and view SMS? Permissions are the ONLY reason I am not \\nusing the app..Sent email ref problem as suggested and pleased to see a new version \\nreleased BUT did not fix issue. Phone registers the A/C and fails to \\ndownload product info. NOT HAPPY STILL NO WORKING. WASTE OF TIME. App \\nupdated & still not getting product data RUBBISH.I have an LG front load washer which supports Tag On feature. I cannot get my Samsung Galaxy S7 to connect to the washer even though the phone supports NFC and has it enabled.. This app is useless..This is a total gimmick. You buy a washer and dryer with a \"tap on\" NFC \\nconnection to your phone. You think there\\'s some value in that. You think \\nyou might be able to do something simple like pair your phone to tell you \\nwhen the load is done. You find out all you can do is \"troubleshoot\" or \\ndownload a custom wash cycle. You do not need either of these things. You \\njust want to be dinged when your load is done so you don\\'t have to keep \\nwalking out to the garage to check on your \"smart\" washer and dryer. But \\nyou can\\'t, do that..I have tried many times to connect our brand new LG fridge freezer to this \\napp via NFC and it refuses. Pretty pointless advertising the benefits of \\nyour smart connection when it won\\'t connect. V disappointed.App requires location, weird but okay. Also wants storage and phone \\ncall/contact information, intrusive but okay I suppose. Finally in order to \\nuse the smart diagnosis or any of the app features you need an account, \\nFine. However, I can\\'t create an account because I don\\'t meet the age \\nrequirements... I\\'m 28 and entered 1990 when trying to establish my \\naccount. Uninstalling and junking my LG units. Terrible application buyers \\nbeware this selling point is a gimmick..I have an AM12BP Air Conditioner and have been trying to connect it to wifi but no matter what I do, it will not work. Wifi was the reason for getting this AC (other than the ionizer) and not getting it to work is a big letdown. My wifi is 2.4Ghz, SSID only uses letters and numbers. I follow the steps, I press the 2 buttons on the remote, the AC beeps, I can see the wifi symbol on the AC, but the process stops at \"The applicaton is connecting to the product\". If I click on the message, it says: \"Error Air Conditioner is either Off or not connected to the network. I have tried multiple times, unplugging AC and reinstalling app. My Router is an Asus RT-AC88U. Devs, if you have any resolution, please reply..Refuses to let you use the app unless you grant certain permissions. If \\nsomething is needed then let me know when I go to use that functionality. \\nThis is lazy and poorly designed..My LG air conditioner can connect to the application but I\\'m left with only \\nbasic controls. Schedules don\\'t work, Google Assistant only works \\noccasionally but won\\'t allow me to change the temperature or mode and the \\nAC decides for me what settings it\\'s going to retain when it comes back \\nonline. This application is useless. Stick with the remote for the portable \\nAC. It\\'s faster to fumble around for the controller than to wait for the \\napp to load and realize it can\\'t do anything differently..Needs work compared to other smart device apps. SLOW to start. Finally \\nafter about 2 months I got it to connect to wifi by turning off my 5mhz \\nnetwork temporarily as it only works with 2.4 for initial connection. \\nAlmost zero documentation on connection..Just wanted to see what the Tap On feature was all about on my aging LG \\nwasher and dryer. So... From what I\\'ve learned so far, I can download a new \\ncycle to my dryer. Okay... I guess that has some value. Oh, and I can \\nattempt to use the \"Tap On\" feature to \"diagnose\" any \"issues\" that may \\ncome up. Well, I tried that and it did work... Only thing is that I havent \\nhad any issues with the dryer so nothing was available to diagnose, but it \\ndid give me some drying tips I was unaware of; not bad. For what I\\'ve done \\nwith it, it seems like a decent app....One of the worst apps I\\'ve ever seen. Cannot login. It keeps trying to \\nlogin even if I created an LG login or use Google account. Android webview \\nsystem is also the highest version. Please fix this bug. Hope it would be a \\nuseful app once you fixed the issues. Thanks..I\\'m using the app on my new fridge. It\\'s ok and I\\'m sure it\\'ll be \\ninvaluable if anything ever goes wrong but they\\'ve missed an opportunity to \\ngive useful information. The most obvious is I\\'d like to know what \\ntemperature the fridge and freezer currently are. It tells me what they\\'re \\nset to but, since I set it, that tells me nothing new..This app asks for horribly intrusive permissons. There is no good reason it needs access to my phone, contacts, amd photos. You explanation for this in an earlier review doesn\\'t make sense. Other apps store data on my phone wihout \"needing to determine storage\" and if you need to know which country just ask me. Why would you need my location to control the AC over wifi? The developer\\'s responses is nonsense. I returned the LG AC unit and bought a GE instead. All their app asks for is camera access to scan the QR code on the unit for setup. Once setup was complete you can turn that off and the GE app still works fine. Go get a GE instead. There is no excuse for all the permissions the LG app wants..$400 air conditioner won\\'t register / sync with the app. I spent extra $$$ \\nto get the unit that has wifi. Just keep getting product registration \\nerror. Please help me. App works fine for my LG fridge..Should be able to select 0 stars. The app won\\'t even open. Goes to failed \\nexecution, try again. So much for connecting equipment to it. Should of \\nstuck with Samsung..Piece of junk. Tried to use with my LG washing machine with smart \\ndiagnosis. Despite all the screeching noises from my washing machine, the \\napp would not work. Delete..Updated review. Better permissions screen when first opened. Unfortunately, \\nit still refuses to run without permissions it doesn\\'t need. It needs \\nlocation permissions for wifi configuration. That makes sense. But I should \\nbe able to revoke it after initial setup. And there\\'s no need to refuse to \\nload without access to my phone. That\\'s just lazy development. If I don\\'t \\nwant to give you permission to my phone, just display the support phone \\nnumber instead if I ever need to call it. Ask for permissions when I try to \\ndo things that need them. Don\\'t block me from using the entire app!.Connected to my fridge/freezer and all the app shows are the set \\ntemperature of the system. Very useless information. I want to know the \\ncurrent temperature. Please update it and include live current temperature \\nreadings..Consider user friendliness! If I am going to download a cycle for a washing \\nmachine, I need to know the details of the cycle. Only a name like training \\nis not enough. It is impossible to find cycle details..Not compatible with the TV I bought just one year ago because I cannot \\nupdate to web os 4.0. Last LG TV I ever buy. It shouldn\\'t be outdated after \\na year..Smart diag has been moved into this app. I dont like having to login just \\nto run a test. Also the test app would not tell me why the ref is 55 degs. \\nOnly that since it was unplugged 5 hrs ago i needed to wait 24 hrs for it \\nto gey cold .nonesence canned script. The unit has been running for a week \\nafter lg service and its still not cold. Defective products require \\nrepeated service calls. And still dont work right. So far morher noard has \\nbeen replaced defrousters and now a factory installed crimp in the cap line \\nwas removed. Had to pay for all of this and still it doesnt cool. And this \\napp says i have not left it plugged in long enough.bought a WM4370HKA and a DLEX4370K and the nfc feature does not work on \\neither of they to connect to this app. using a Samsung s7 - you can hear \\nthe nfc register but never does anything afterwards on the install.How to set the notification from my washer to only appear in the standard \\nsystem notifications, and not show the pop-up window? This behavior is \\ncompletely non-standard, annoying, and totally unacceptable, as it even \\nwakes the display (!!!), which can lead to unintentional touches on the \\nscreen when the phone is in my pocket. The only other option is to disable \\nnotifications, but I want to be notified, I just don\\'t want to get the \\nintrusive pop-up. Let me set to have the notification just in the \\nnotification panel, just as every single other app does it..The permissions required to simply control appliances are far too \\nintrusive. Uninstalled as soon as I realized this..Tells me I am rooted. I am not I have ran software to test. Plus I checked \\nsafetynet and my certificate is valid. So this is a bug and needs to be \\nfixed..Update review (10-07-2018): A month after my initial review, I wish I could give this app 0 stars as it simply does not do what it is intended to do and 0 stars for LG customer service. I have emailed these guys with screenshots but nothing came from it. Not even an acknowledgement. Shows you how much they care. I have followed their instructions as per their response below, but its a generic how to connect instruction. It fails everytime at the end with the error \"Product registration failed\". PLEASE DO NOT BUY LG WD1411SBW 11kg washing machine, it does not work with this app.  Original review (17-06-2018) : Stupid app. Tried setting up with LG WD1411SBW 11kg washing machine. Has  got to be possibly the worst designed connection setup process ever. It  just keeps looping in circles. Never actually connects the appliance to the  home network. Yes, I\\'m using 2.4GHZ network, yes I\\'ve got my password typed  correctly. Please fire the developer and how someone who knows what they\\'re  doing. This is not rocket science. Make it easy for the customer, not this  bloody difficult. Gaddamn!.Installed without a problem but then refused to run saying it can not run \\non a rooted device. Problem is my device is not rooted..Tag on does not work. It gets 30% then an error. Waste of time and waste of \\nmoney buying LG appliances with Tag On if it doesnt even work..Very easy to set up with my 11kg front loader(WD1411SBW) and my phone, \\nparticularly compared to Samsung\\'s app and 11kg washer which were a pain to \\nset up. (that washer broke after 1 wash, so we got the LG) The app is a bit \\nsluggish to open and connect, but the \"wash complete\" notifications work \\ngreat, which was the main feature that I wanted. I\\'ve deducted points \\nbecause I can\\'t seem to edit existing washes(like changing the temp, spin \\nspin speed etc) which you can do on the machine itself! I also can\\'t see a \\nway to create custom washes from scratch, which I\\'d a shame! If there\\'s a \\nway to do the above from the app, then let me know and I\\'ll change my \\nrating! I know why they are required but I\\'m also not keen on the \\npermissions required to run the app...seems excessive when all I want is to \\ncontrol my washer remotely!.I have an LG 2018 and Alexa, couldn\\'t pair them at all. Apparently it \"may \\nnot work on 5ghz networks\". Sorry didn\\'t realise this was 2008....I have the LG LP1417WSRSM Portable AC, and I am now able to change the mode \\nsetting finally using the app on my device. Changed my rating from 1 star \\nto 5 star..I\\'m a tech savvy person and could not get a single aspect of this app to \\nwork with my brand new compatible washing machine..The app reported to me that the refrigerator needed new air and water \\nfilters. It linked me to a website to get the replacement filters and the \\napp pushed the wrong filters..I bought LG appliances so I could integrate with Google home! Unfortunately \\nthough, I can only control directly via this app and it will not work with \\nGoogle home! Come on LG, fix this please!!.I had initial issues when connecting the app to my refrigerator, thou the \\nmanual says your routers name should be in English and no special \\ncharacter, my router was named \\'toysoldier\\' the refrigerator could see the \\nrouter and even connect but the issue was the app keeps say unable to \\nregister product,i had to change the router\\'s name before the app could \\nfully work with the device.Thats not smart at all..I hate it! When I try to select a downloaded wash/dry cycle I get an error \\nsaying it has lost connection to the network or the appliance is turned \\noff. Neither is true, router is located only a few feet away..°¡Àü ÇÏ³ª »ç¿ëÇÏ´Âµ¥ ¹«½¼ ·Î±×ÀÎ? ´©±¸¸¦ À§ÇÑ ·Î±×ÀÎÀÔ´Ï±î?

Now it\\'s just the same as \\ncottons!.Helps me keep a good tracked ng on how my washing machines work I \\nrecelently bought a new front charger washing machine so lets keep it in \\ngood function.Last update had killed my link. Can\\'t access fridge control anymore..Software says my phone is rooted. NOT! What a waste of time..It\\'s really nice. But should have more options like locking the fridge or \\nswitching off completely and user manual etc.Can not run on rooted device. Why??? This supose to be app for my fridge? \\nEven my mobile bank apps work on rooted phone, but not LG fridge app....As we only have an LG washer this app only has very limited use. But a \\nnotification when the wash has finished does come in useful..Want option to say NO to using my location, photos, eyc..Disconecction issues recurring even after update. Rendering it usesless.Can\\'t fully control my washing machine. Can\\'t figure out how to upload \\ncustom wash cycles to the machine..Doesn\\'t connect liked needed even after update. Useless!!!.L\\'application ne d?marre pas. Lorsque je lance manuellement ou que je connecte par le tag NFC sur la machine, j\\'ai juste un ?cran vide qui \"pop\" et dispara?t instantan?ment.  **EDIT**  Maintenant l\\'application me dit \"can not run on rooted device\" mais mon tel n\\'est pas root? (v?rifi? avec root checker). Je crois que si je pouvais mettre z?ro ?toile je le ferais..Does exactly what it is supposed to do and I love that I can get an alert \\nwhen cycle is done so I don\\'t have wasted trips to the basement to check!.Depending on the equipment sometimes the diagnostic portion can be \\ntemperamental to work with....Can\\'t connect AC. App is poorly designed..The A/C is great and the app is awesomeq.Great app to use with LG appliances. Can set stuff away from home..Doesn\\'t work on rooted phones..The best app ever. I can wash my delicate underwear and other clothes which \\nare not pink from another town/city/ country..Would be nice if the app displayed the current temperature in the freezer \\nand fridge..While at work I can know the washer is operate by someone at home..can \\nremind them by sms it done washing if they are sleeping.Won\\'t run on my LG V30, says the phone has root access,when the phone is \\nnot rooted!.The app is not working. I can\\'t connect to my washer despite All the tries..Sometimes it disconnects and it has not enough features home location \\ndoesn\\'t work properly.Love that I can monitor my washer and dryer with this app. LG beats my old \\nbrand washer in a heartbeat. Best money I ever spent..Very cool to know that the dishes are clean so when I get home for dinner I \\ndon\\'t have to wash dirty dishes to eat..Some of the wording is a bit strange but still it\\'s completely \\nunderstandable..I do like the application. Find it useful and helpful..The app must be updated because the background is too whitish and the fonts \\nsize is small... There is needs for improvement....Already used it to register a new product and resolve an issue with a \\ndishwasher. Worked like a charm..Why do you need access to my contacts?.It sucks just an app to get permissions on your phone.Requires to many permissions and an account...deleted!.Does not support IFTTT with smartThink q washer in India.Product failed to register..No Energy monitoring option on my LG AC.Maybe got more options in controlling the aircon like sxheduled timings.Nice when it tells me the kids left the fridge door open..Love getting notified when my laundry is done..Never before have I seen such a big app do so little so slowly..Excellent app very useful gives great tips to keep your machine running \\nefficienctly.To use this App you must be near the machine..Release the support for india for alexa and Google.Using it with my washer. Works ok, though it could start a bit faster..it\\'s good app. very useful. but slow.No repair man required.Would not open.Ok to use but hell to install....Thanks LG!.Been using this app for a month now and works flawlessly..A good app easy to set up and use.Pretty Awesome To Use, Loved It!.Works perfectly.

The set up never finished \\nverifying the connection on my Samsung, after hours of leaving my phone on \\nthe final step. Set up was completed on my husband\\'s IPhone, but we were \\nunder the impression you could control the appliance away from home but all \\nthat shows on the main menu is \"getting the data.\".Worked great last year. Just put my air con up and updated the app, not \\nconnecting properly.. Is there an update coming put soon the pix this? \\nSeems like I\\'m not the only one with connection problems..The AC is next to the router and yet has issues connecting. Seems like LG  doesn\\'t test their products. Horrible app execution. Even after disconnection the AC, rebooting the router and re installing the app it still has major issues connecting. It connects maybe 1 out of 10 times. Needs better developers..Takes forever to connect or error message saying not connected or poor \\ninternet connection. Router is in same space and with excellent reception \\nfor all of my other devices. Super buggy, not reliable and laggyness makes \\nthis app useless for its intended purpose..Works fine. For those who say it doesn\\'t work with a rooted phone, they\\'re \\nwrong. Use Magisk for root and Magisk hide to hide root from the app. \\nBingo. It works fine. Takes time to find the NFC and transfer the programs \\nbut maybe that\\'s because its new to me..The latest update has left this basically useless. More bloat and \\nunnecessary items like local temperature... Make it fast and stable. Latest \\ntwo updates caused app to not work at all. I can\\'t use it at all. It\\'s \\nfinally working again, and fast. Thank you you or fixing it..Update June 2018: I ditched my LG phone and got a Samsung. Now the app \\nworks. Hahaha. Way to undermine your own company, LG! I\\'ll never buy an LG \\nphone again. (Love your appliances and TVs though.) In response to the \\ndev\\'s questions, no my previous phone wasn\\'t rooted. Your app just didn\\'t \\nwork. It couldn\\'t even get past the launch screen before crashing. And yes \\nI uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times..The app won\\'t connect to my LG washer WM4370HKA using NFC. I tried for over \\nan hour and found the exact spot that my phone needed to be a few times, \\nbut the registration failed every time at 30%. I didn\\'t move my phone \\nduring the registration process. I have never had a problem using Samsung \\nPay with my Galaxy S7 and I use it a few times a week..Tried connecting my new refrigerator, followed the directions exactly as \\nthey\\'re laid out in the app and receive an error message saying it\\'s \\nunavailable every single time. Update: Re-installing the app helped and my \\nfridge is now paired to the wifi. The app is a little clunky but iverall \\nworks well. One thing I\\'m unsure of is how to activate away/vacation mode, \\nI haven\\'t found it yet in my limited use..Slow to load, slow to control, crashed the three times I tried it. I did  get it to control my AC, but it is much faster to climb three flights of  stairs then to wait for this app to load. *EDIT* no fault of the app but I am returning the AC unit: the compressor start up is very noisy..The WiFi on the fridge probably increased its price. What\\'s the point of \\nthis app? Useless WiFi, pointless app. We can track our own groceries far \\nmore efficiently..*UPDATE* after days of messing around with this thing off and on I finally \\nfigured out that when it says the SSID may not contain special characters, \\nthey also mean that the wifi PASSWORD can also not contain any special \\ncharacters. Setup a guest network, made a basic, insecure password since it \\ncan\\'t contain special characters, and it connected right to it. Thanks LG \\nfor your garbage app and garbage security. Will definitely be returning \\nthis and getting a Samsung. Unbelievable. For those of you having the same \\nissue, try that, I\\'ll bet it works. Got a window AC today. Spent 2 hours \\ntrying to get the app to work. Registers device but will never connect just \\nhangs. Tried your very generic response to literally EVERYONE with the same \\nAC problem here. Uninstalled the app, disconnected power, reinstalled app, \\nstill doesn\\'t work, what a shocker. How are you going to advertise a \\nfeature that just flat out doesn\\'t work?.Update.....thanks for the May 23rd update. The A/C is now working again \\nwith the app.........Since your update it won\\'t connect to my air \\nconditioner. It just said network connection unstable please wait. It \\nconnect to my Wi-Fi everything is fine on my end it\\'s the app. The phones \\nthe app ate also up dated so that\\'s not the problem. I installed and re \\ninstall still the same. Pls fix it. You must realize since to may 10th \\nupdate that people are complaining.The app is so slow.. My internet is a 75mbps.. every click in the app I do \\nI frees the phone for 5-10sec.. I held my phone to register washer for 10 \\nmin.. nothing picked up to be registered.. too disappointing considering \\nthis is an LG brand.Your 09/05/2018 terms of service changes \"For enhanced service\" made me discontinue use of your service. Sorry LG, I\\'m not gonna continue giving you access to my device info so you can whore it out to third partied or data mine and not be held liable if you have data leaks. Closing out all LG accounts. People concerned about your data, take the 10-15 mins and read the terms of service. It\\'s not good!.Works for about a week before my ac stops connecting to wifi. Really wanted \\nto use this away from home but after reading other reviews, it\\'s clear LG \\ndoesn\\'t care. Ac works great, but Pointless app. Just use the remote....Update: I can connect to the app if I disconnect from my WiFi connection \\nand use wireless data. Not ideal, but at least I can use the app now. I was \\nable to connect the app to my new window AC unit easily, but next day I \\ncan\\'t even open the app. I get stuck at \"Failed Execution. Try again.\" and \\ncan\\'t get any further. Huge bummer since remote access to the AC was one of \\nthe primary reasons for my purchase. Using an unaltered Samsung Galaxy S7. \\nI have uninstalled and reinstalled several times, with no luck..Literal Garbage, App Failed Execution. Love paying over 2400 USD for a \\nlaundry pair and get shafted because a dedicated button that relies on the \\napp doesn\\'t work because they hired literal Apes to program the app..Love that I can adjust the rinse aid usage and have extra options for \\ncycles that are not on the dishwasher, I e. Casserole, pots n pans, night \\ntime (makes the machine run even quieter than it already does). Also, love \\nthat it tells me when you should run a clean cycle and runs diagnostics if \\nthere are problems. Hopefully will be getting more LG smart products in the \\nfuture so I can use other functions of the app..Takes forever to connect (1 out of 20) or error message saying  my AC is LP1417WSRSM \"Getting the data and then \"error air conditioner is either Off or not connected to the network check product networks OK\" I have perfect WiFi for all other devices. Called tech. support - he said I am not the only one.suffering Let\\'s see if they fix it..Totally useless ! Just bought LG Washer, download this huge memory (200 MB) \\napp, hoping that is useful.. wrong.. ! - No information how to use - NFC \\nnot functioning. Don\\'t know what this App for !.The app used to work with our Heat pumps but now it mostly times out. After \\n10 minutes it may show 1 of 4 devices, but when I select one to control it, \\nit claims network issues. Network is fine. Roll back to old version until \\nyou sort out coding issues. You do not need access to my location or my \\npermission to use my phone or access my phone number and identity. Turn \\nthose requirements off and I\\'ll consider using your app. Until then, we are \\ndone. (Edit) after deleting the app and reinstalling it I was able to \\nconnect to my heat pumps. But, it is the only app on my phone that \\nimmediately stops working when I disable Location and access to my phone \\nfunction. The App is disabled again until LG respects my privacy..App worked first time, No probs. Don\\'t understand why people can\\'t get \\nsomething so simple to connect. LW1217ERSM Window A.C. unit connected to \\nWi-Fi within 20 secs., App synced in another 15-20 secs, and using a Galaxy \\nS7. Just picked up the A.C. unit from my local DIY store, and had \\neverything completed in under 2 hours.. Bring on the Nor-Cal/Central Valley \\nheat !.Why does the app need access to my contacts and phone numbers? As well as \\nmy pictures and videos? Really? Every time I launch the app it tries to re \\nregister my A/C unit and fails to connect most of the time..app is trash \\njust a data mining app ..sad..my air conditionner is connected, and the app either say \"off\" even if i\\'m standing next to it and it\\'s clearly on... or when i click on it when it detects it on it says \"network connection is unstable\"  even if my phone connection is strong and the AC is connected to my wifi.This app is very useful. A code poped up on my washer and when i did he \\ndiagnosis it told me exactly what was wrong and hopeful ways to fix it..This app has been junk since the beginning. Explain to me why I can\\'t even \\nrun it now as it does not support rooted devices..Hope they fix this app because I tried putting in my date of birth and it \\nsays there\\'s a ago requirement smh ha I think im well over the age of 17 \\n(32) horrible app did even get to us it.Absolutely garbage. Does nothing with my LG portable AC. Read some reviews \\nelsewhere, this is a known issue with LG. It\\'s dog poo.The app has worked for me and my washer with tag on for the last 6 months, \\nbut the app is HUGE and very slow, even on a galaxy s8. The permissions are \\nworrisome - why do you need so many permissions just to download a washer \\ncycle?.My front loader washing machine wouldn\\'t drain the water. With the app \\ndiagnosis, I was able to fix the problem..This app doesnt work with my LG air conditioner. Apparently it doesn\\'t work \\nfor nearly anyone else either. Will be returning my unit tommorow and not \\nbuying LG again. Samsung from now on..New lg washer and dryer, both have NFC connections, not able to connect our \\nphones at all. Called help desk 12x, automated answering service call back \\nlater. No good..It was so helful to diagnose my washer error. It saved time and money \\nbecause i didnt have to call in a repair.Just got an AC and the app is returning an error after registering the AC, \\nno matter how many times I try registering it. Not sure what\\'s going on..Update 5/23/18 still not working Still no email from LG Phone is not rooted \\n4/12/2018: so I have emailed the developer 3 times now I have still not \\nreceived a single reply there was an update again today and this update \\nstill does not work says I am rooted and my phone has never been rooted \\nmaybe next update one can only hope.....*** The developer asked me to send \\nan email to them I did this weeks ago still no email back terrible app and \\nterrible support not what you would expect from LG so much for smart \\nappliances what a waste The app will not open pixel XL 2 I uninstalled the \\napp and reinstalled still not working not rooted USA When I try to open it \\nsays my phone is rooted but my phone is not and has never been rooted just \\nupdated still not working.Finally got it working lg air con. But very disappointing experience... \\nMonths to fix.The app forgets connected devices from time to time. Sometimes the paring \\nprocess is not successful whatever you try..This review contains 3 updates over 2 years. 2017 - Forced to use this app \\ninstead of LG Smart app - was very happy controlling my LG mini split \\nsystem remotely with the LG Smart App. I had no issues with the LG Smart \\nApp whatsoever. I was very happy. But as of this past weekend I was forced \\nto upgrade to this app now and having all sorts of issues connecting to my \\nAC / Heat mini split. What once was a very easy process of managing my \\nunits has turned into a nightmare. I constantly get errors saying that my \\nproduct is unavailable or connection cancelled. What makes matters worse is \\nthese units are installed in a secondary home so remote capability is \\nparamount. Will not buy LG products any longer based on this experience. \\nSorry I made this mistake up front. You live, you learn. April 30 update - \\nhave sinced fixed the issues above and added 2 more devices to control. \\nEasy setup and love the app and its design. You need to power off the \\ncircuit for the install of the wifi module you are installing. Then it will \\nbe recognized in the setup. Working as advertised so all is well!! May 23 \\n2018 Update... App sucks again after updates. I\\'m controlling 5 Wifi \\nmodules for 5 Mini-split AC units. Takes way to long to pull the data for \\neach unit and then gives a \"network unstable message\" after I select a unit \\nto manage. After this it needs to refresh all 5 units and takes forever \\nagain. Never-ending cycle of madness. Stabilize this app!!!.Requires a lot personal info and then says it cannot connect to my router. \\nIt\\'s supposed to control a window a.c. but it shows no controls..This app works for me coz i run my ref using solar energy. I can check if \\nsomething goes wrong with this app.I am appreciative of the fact for this app. Since it is able to capture \\nsimple traction of my energy and usage patterns. Kudos to the developers \\nand hopefully more patterns or traction is made available, for example \\nwater level of measurement of energy by wattage in terms of units.Very quick diagnosis for the problems with my washer. Great work. Done in \\nless than 5 minutes. No issues. Useful!.Thinks my Pixel 2 XL is rooted and won\\'t run. My phone is absolutely NOT \\nrooted...what a waste....¬¬¬Ó¬Ö¬ã¬ä, ¬ã¬â¬Ñ¬Ó¬ß¬Ú¬Þ¬í¬Û ¬á¬à ¬ã¬Ý¬à¬Ø¬ß¬à¬ã¬ä¬Ú ¬ã ¬å¬ã¬ä¬Ñ¬ß¬à¬Ó¬Ü¬à¬Û ¬Õ¬Ú¬Ù¬Ö¬Ý¬î¬ß¬à¬Ô¬à ¬Õ¬Ó¬Ú¬Ô¬Ñ¬ä¬Ö¬Ý¬ñ ¬à¬ä \\n¬¬¬Ñ¬ä¬Ö¬â¬á¬Ú¬Ý¬Ý¬Ö¬â¬Ñ ¬Ó ¬Þ¬à¬á¬Ö¬Õ. ¬¯¬Ö ¬ç¬à¬é¬å ¬Þ¬Ñ¬ä¬Ö¬â¬Ú¬ä¬î¬ã¬ñ, ¬á¬â¬à¬ã¬ä¬à ¬å¬Õ¬Ú¬Ó¬Ý¬Ö¬ß, ¬Ü¬Ñ¬Ü ¬ä¬Ñ¬Ü¬à¬Ö ¬ã¬í¬â¬à¬Ö \\n¬á¬â¬Ú¬Ý¬à¬Ø¬Ö¬ß¬Ú¬Ö ¬á¬â¬à¬ê¬Ý¬à ¬Ó¬ß¬å¬ä¬â¬Ö¬ß¬ß¬Ú¬Ö ¬ä¬Ö¬ã¬ä¬í..Notifications are working again, still somewhat slow connecting..¾Æ´Ï ¹ö±× °íÃÆ´Ù¸é¼\\xad ¿Ö Á¦Ç° ÀÎ½ÄÀÌ ¾ÈµÇÁÒ? ¿ÍÀÌÆÄÀÌ »óÅÂ¶û ¿ø°ÝÁ¦¾îµµ ´Ù ÄÑ³ù´Âµ¥ °è¼Ó ¿¬°áÇØÁ¦¶ó°í¸¸ ¶ß°í,,,.Doesn\\'t work.

NO WAY LG!!!.Znacajno poboljsanje sa novom verzijom..Terrible. Disconnecting always.Instant info on washing machine fault. Really handy..Do not buy lg appliances.Can we use mobile data to connect or we should wifi thwn it will work?.Confirmed existence of a fault that i suspected.The app connected maybe 1 of 20 times. Please fix.Worked 1st day on the air conditioner now it won\\'t connect.?? ????? ?????.To setup,hold down \"Power\" and Fan, not Mode and Fan..Easily told me what to fix with my new LG washer!.works for me :).App cant even start -_-.Hitch and hassle free.Super fast..Horrible.awsome unit.Great.Useful.....Cool.Good.Washer and dryer registered and notified their status for a week or so and \\nthen just quit one day. They still wash and dry but app connectivity was \\nnil. What ended up solving this was to set up a separate network with no \\nsecurity and restricted it to only allow the washer and dryer to connect to \\nit. Both connected right up and report their status again. The remote \\nnotification is a nice feature that influenced our purchase. Lucky Goldstar \\nclearly expects everyone who buys their products to be a network engineer..I just purchased 3 LG Air conditioner. The app doesn\\'t work I have eero \\nnetwork and it\\'s in the same room as my LG air conditioner and still not \\nworking. I Followed the app instructions and it finds the network work and \\nregisters the AC to the app. But the app always shows ( getting data \\ninformation but doesn\\'t change. ) I have a appointment for a technician to \\ncome out to resolve on the 5/23/18 but if not working after that I will be \\nreturning the 3 air conditioners I have just bought..I went through the setup several times. Everything is appears to be \\nsuccessful, however when I try to use the app to control the air \\nconditioner, it always tells me that the device is not connected. I go into \\nproduct details and sure enough, it is connected to my WiFi and \\nregistration is complete. I could have saved a ton of money but going with \\na conventional air conditioner and a WiFi connected receptacle..App is not working as promoted. Dryer is connected to wifi. App used to \\nfind the data so I could download new cycles remotely. App claims that \\nremote start is turned on but then will just keeps searching and searching \\nfor dryer status until claiming it\\'s off even after the app stated that \\nremote start was turned on. So frustrating to have a feature that doesn\\'t \\nwork due to a faulty app. Get your S**t together LG..Wish I read the reviews here before purchasing our air conditioner! \\nConnected once! Uninstalled reinstalled, still doesn\\'t connect. Probably \\nreturning air conditioner and going with another brand. Major fail LG. \\nThink I\\'m done with LG..Permissions are excessive, and requires me to enter my Wi-Fi password into \\nthe app after signing into an LG account, and giving the app \\'call\\' \\npermissions. My phone already has my WiFi password. This dir a different \\nreason. This is much more than a WiFi app. It\\'s an Internet and phone call \\napp for my dryer to phone home to LG. No thanks..Notification UI needs to be redone, plain and simple. If an appliance pings \\none\\'s device, the notification is not a proper notification tray type \\nnotification, it is a pop-up window circa Android Donut. How this made it \\ninto production without being rethought is beyond me, as an unattended \\ndevice will drain of battery due to the display being held on wake lock by \\nthis inane notification. If you must use this app I highly recommend \\nturning off all notification function to prevent battery drain..Looks like a really amateur app. Have been trying to connect my new lg washer dryer to my android phone without any luck. No real aids to trouble shoot the issue. A real pain!.Smart Laundry was perfect. This update make it far too complicated, not \\nuser friendly at all! Mainly women washes laundry, not IT guru\\'s! Why do \\nyou need permission for camera, contacts, etc? Spying LG customers? Size of \\napp is too big. All over - this update is a disaster!! Think before you \\nact!!! This will keep me away from other LG products if needed something \\nelse than washing machine....LG\\'s \"smart\" technology is a joke. Anytime I try to pull up my dryer in the \\napp it either gets stuck on \"getting the data\" or pulls up what I\\'m \\nassuming is supposed to be the control panel for the dryer but is only list \\na few random characters and blank space. LG should be embarrassed about the \\nobvious low quality of this app and their smart appliances..Had a mandated update on the app, now all I get is connection issues. This \\napp is now useless unless LG tech corrects this issue. However, judging by \\nthe previous comments, nothing is being done about it. It\\'s a shame.....I just bought new washer with Tag On. Can only download cycle that aren\\'t \\navailable. Also, no status on current the machine cycles. Deleting this \\ngarbage app. Worthless waste of storage space on my device. Love the \\nwashing machine..For the past few months I was searching for a wifi enabled air conditioning \\nunit to add to my home. I bought one from LG in hopes that I wouldn\\'t have \\nany issues. I mean, we\\'re talking about a company who has years of \\nexperience and a high standard in quality control. Well, I was very \\ndisappointed. I tested the unit right next to my router and the only result \\nwere intermittent connectivity and the app telling me the unit was \\n\"offline\". Come on LG, fix this and step up your game!!!!.Got as far as the app asking to get access to basically everything on my \\nphone - photos, make calls etc and then thought I better read the reviews. \\nSaw how terrible it is and uninstalled. Doesn\\'t do anything for fridges \\nother than give you the temperature anyway. Not a lot of point to it..This is one worst app, I tried may be like 20 times to set my refrigerator \\non wifi, every time it says cannot register or failed to connect. Now \\nthinking why did I purchased this refrigerator better to go to samsung \\nwhere things are much better apps.Worked at first but now usually refuses to connect to my air conditioner, \\nsays \"network connection is unstable\" even though the WiFi is quite good in \\nthe AC location and phone location. I can usually eventually connect to \\nwhere I can hit the power at least, but it almost always fails to get into \\nthe detail settings where you can change temperature and fan speed and so \\non. Appears to have started this after an update..This app worked great for the past 5ish months but after the recent update \\nthere is a constant issue with connectivity and slow load times when it \\ndoes work, the supposed bug fix update added bugs where before I had none. \\nEstar for the precious build..App unreliably gets data from washer/dryer (just keeps saying \"getting \\ndata\"). Wish you could change the push notification sound (to make it \\nunique sounding for this app compared to my regular default notification \\nsound). Wish remote control would remain on once I turn it on. Needs more \\nfunctions with Alexa skill (such as washer/dryer cycle end notification). \\nWay too many permissions needed. Keep updating the app please to improve it..I love the refrigerator. The app is easy to install and register. My router \\nis 20 feet from the refrigerator in a direct line of sight and it fails to \\nmaintain connectivity. Essentially, the app is worthless. I was hoping all \\nthe poor ratings on here were inaccurate. They are not. Fortunately, \\nuninstalling the app is super easy too..Wow LG I expect better from you. I just bought a brand new washer and dryer. They work great, but the only thing that works with the app is the notifications. How am I supposed to start them away from home when the app is always \"Getting the data....\"? They registered to my wifi easily, but they will not work with the app. I can\\'t start them or at times even see the status. My washer shows as off right now when I know it is on and it is in the middle of a 5 hour delayed start. I had to do the delayed start because the app won\\'t work well enough for me to start it at later today while I\\'m away. You need to let your customers know what is going on with your app and what is being done to fix it. This app and it\\'s functionalities were one of the biggest purchasing factors for me. I sure hope you are fixing this. If not, I will never buy another LG device again. To be honest, I\\'m looking for a new tv and refrigerator now. LG is not high on my list as I apparently can\\'t trust you..Completely f\\'n useless. Will not stay connected to device. Thankfully I \\nbought Samsung washer & dryer, works perfect! Was just hoping something as \\nsimple as an ac unit would work! Nope. App is junk as everyone is stating..It seems LG checks these reviews and occasionally responds, so I hope this message reaches someone on their team and it can be routed to the appropriate person  LG, I installed the app to work with my washer and dryer and it worked fine for months.  On May 11, there was an update to your app.  Since then, the app no longer finds my dryer and occasionally can find my washer but when it does, it takes a very long time.  You\\'ve been directing Google Play reviewers to read how to install your app, but I suggest sending a message to your app development team and let them know many many users are complaining that the May 11 update broke something in the app and it\\'s not working properly..I echo the accounts of other recent reviewers: Whether due to a recent app update or some other change, the LG SmartThinQ system is now basically unusable for me. Although my air conditioner is connected to my wireless network, the LG SmartThinQ app either does not see it at all or, after an extended delay, recognizes the air conditioner but then is unable to control it and gives a network error message. Phone tech support seems to be completely unaware of this widespread problem (treating it instead like a problem with my individual unit or settings) and does not offer effective solutions..The entire Smart ThinQ service appears to be borderline inoperable.  I was looking forward to having an app to control my new air conditioner but while there\\'s no problem in configuring to get online, it\\'s connectivity beings so infrequent that the function might as well not exist.  Some other reviews suggest it is a fault by an update from LG, I\\'m unsure, but my network itself shows no problems.  I hope they fix it but at this point I can only say that LG\\'s Smart ThinQ feature should be avoided by consumers entirely..After I finally got this app to work with my air conditioner it seemed okay \\nfor the first month but after that it has network connection issues? None \\nof my other devices do this that I use with wireless just the LG air \\nconditioner and this app!.I wish I could say I liked this app because I love the fridge. But in \\nreality I can\\'t get the app to respond quickly, can\\'t see where to reset \\nthe water filter which it tells me to do and generally it seems pretty much \\nuseless. Sorry. I could get it to connect though....LG waveforce washer is garbage. And the smart diagnosis didnt work. 100% \\nbalanced load will not finish because it says its uneven.Update - app requires too many permissions. App won\\'t run unless you give \\naway all your location, access to photos, even wants access to your \\ncamera.....Installed to use with our washer and dryer. App won\\'t run unless \\nyou grant it location and photos permissions. No thanks... Neither of those \\nservices should be required for me to see the status of my appliances..It doesn\\'t work and, after numerous calls to LG, they admit it doesn\\'t work \\nso now we have to return our WiFi enabled A/C unit and find another \\nsolution..This app fails so hard it is becoming funny... I just do not get what all \\nthat loading and downloading product information means... It is very sad \\nthat this is official app that someone approved ...App says there is an update and won\\'t run without installing it. App store \\nsays I have the latest installed. Also can\\'t communicate with the oven. LG \\nbecoming my mistake instead of a good decision..I used the old app quite a bit, but this one is terrible. It is buggy, \\ninconsistent and the UI is frustrating. It takes too long to load add well..Crashes, hangs. And takes longer to reset my ac than physically walking to \\nevery unit in the house. Poor customer support, and spyware like \\npermissions requirements..Requiring location phone and storage permissions to function is ridiculous. \\nAfter all of that it still requires a user account before even allowing \\nuser to use to app with an appliance. Dumb..(Pixel 2) It just didn\\'t work. You open the fridge section and you go to \\nturn a setting on or off and it won\\'t let you. The switch just stays where \\nit was before you tapped it. Very disappointing..Worst app ever. Never works right. You are better than this LG!.It worked perfectly with my AC when I got it but the app will no longer \\nconnect, the AC is connected to the Wi-Fi but the app won\\'t work because \\nit\\'s absolute garbage.This app works great if you have a modern device and configure your wifi to \\nwork well with the 2,4gHz-only connection! All the negative reviews must be \\nhacked, rooted or ancient devices with impatient users as we have had not \\none problem with more than 5 smart appliances in a very large home. Well \\ndone, LG and devs!.Hunk of garbage, cannot vonnect and useless. (i workbin the tech field, \\nthis is not usefull for anyone including developers)!.I buy a new LG laundry machine and i wished to use this app. But it didn\\'t \\nenter to new acount at all!!! I\\'am very disappointed :-(.Junk. Do not download. Does not even connect. Says registration process \\nfailed while connecting to our servers.... Just junk.....It just does not work, either on iOS or Android. Bought a wifi AC and the \\napp never works. Ubelievable..The app keeps telling me that I have to verify through an email link to \\nregister, but it won\\'t send me the email. The email is typed in correctly \\nand I\\'ve tried 4 times. No email, so I can\\'t register..Horrible app, Pay extra money for a Wi-Fi AC, As of a reviewers have stated \\ndoes not work or at least 95% of the time, nothing wrong with the AC Just a \\nhorrible app that if it would work right would be absolutely great and very \\nuseful!.Window air conditioners in the app say network unstable. But it worked \\nbefore the last update..Doesn\\'t work at all, opens and gies to black screen with few icons and \\nthats it, cant do anything.I have a Galaxy S8. I gave up after trying to get it to work with my air conditioner. Uninstalled it..Finally got this setup but it\\'s not easy. The app asks for way to many \\npermissions - all I wanted was the status of my washing why do you need \\ndevice storage, contacts, camera, microphone, etc just for that! The only \\nbig thing I can understand you might need is location and that\\'s at a push. \\nOn the comments LG have left for other people who have complained about \\nthis; usim info to get then country - do you really need to do that? Can\\'t \\nyou just ask the user for their country or use the location service which \\nyou have also asked for permission for? And storage to determine if you can \\ninstall the app?? Huh? How can the app run something before it\\'s installed \\nto determine if it can be installed..? Play store manages all that. sorry \\nbut I\\'m a software developer and it all doesn\\'t sound right to me... Anyway \\nnow its setup I can view the status of my washing but push notifications \\nnever work. I tried a plan b of connecting the account to Google home, \\nfirst issue is you can\\'t use the standard LG account I setup instead you \\nneed to link to your Google account. But after going through the hassle of \\nregistering again with my Google account and linking the washer to it all \\nthat I get in google assistant is \\'LG isn\\'t responding at the moment\\' :-( I \\nthen realised you can link the lg account to if this then that (ITTT) wow I \\nthought this would be cool, so gave that a go... But I can\\'t even link the \\naccounts up for that I just get \"device does not match region settings. \\nchange region settings\" when I sign in to the account, ahh so frustrating! \\nSo basically it\\'s a fail. LG seem to have had lots of really good ideas but \\nthe technical implementation is really disappointing. Hopefully given time \\nthen it will all get looked at but it\\'s really not up to scratch at the \\nmoment, I\\'m amazed it all got through their QA process! Sorry LG Update - \\nJust gone down another start for answering with your standard reply!.Worked fine when initially installed, controlling my 4 split units but now \\nit never connects, constantly showing the devices as off and unable to \\nupdate..LG AC we purchased in April and I was able to install app and connect to \\nWiFi in less than 5 minutes. I wish also able to. On next through mobile \\ndata and also swing options :) now my home is smart home of. LG.To check temperature of my fridge i need to give permission to GPS, \\nmicrophone, camera, files on phone, sms.... I will never agree.it was working fine.... but they launch an update and now isnt working \\namymore. unstable network all the time its all i get. downgrade it or fix \\nit now!!!.I only used this app 1nce to dwnload a cycle but wen i put it on to dwnload \\nanother cycle the page just doesnt load at all. Its just a white blank \\npage. Ive deleted it n am going to re install it 1nce more then if it fails \\nill delete it fully. So much for downloadable cycle function..Won\\'t connect to my AC. Get as far as the verify connection button and just \\nget a spinning \\'checking\\' button for 5-10 minutes..The app never displays the data from my fridge. It always says gathering \\ndata and never goes away..So ridiculously slow to load ( AC controls) it\\'s faster to walk upstairs \\nand turn it on..Only white screen after last update!.It requests more than needed permission to do basic jobs..Pretty bad. Bad UI. Unclear what it is supposed to do..Would like to see A.C. unit runtimes, but very handy to control my \\nmini-split..Worthless. Does not connect..It s good but must have another things.This app is junk!!!.It gave my washing machine a good diagnostic and I was able to fix it \\nmyself. Great feature.Limited functionality for a fridge/freezer however quite useful.The app is great. My only wish is that it worked via wifi and not just NFC.What a piece of s@#$.Beautiful refrigerator and this handy diagnosis feature will deffintely \\nhelp in the future.Useless!.Need to be more fast.It only allows to monitor.Works great!.This app is great.Great App.Great!.very useful.Love it.Excellent.Good.LG\\'s support is pretty good. At least I got a reply. I still say that the \\nprogram requires too many permissions (making calls and location \\nacquisition are sensitive settings) to even start. It also does not work \\nwithout network connectivity. Washing machine is good, the app should be \\nusable in restricted state. I can fill my information if I want to. :-/.This app has been intrusive, barely functioning trash for over a year. It \\nserves no useful function and refuses to function without absolute and \\nextrodinary permissions. The wm9000hva is a wonderful washer a year + \\nlater, but the software is so bad I will avoid anything LG related to \\nandroid, including their phones as a result.Cannot run on Verizon Google Pixel 2XL, says \"cannot run on rooted device\", \\nthis phone is unrootable and one of the most compatible Android phone \\ncurrently made. What a joke of an app, you guys MADE this phone, LG made \\nthe Pixel 2XL, and yet this LG app won\\'t run on your own phone. What a time \\nto be alive..Very disappointed. I wanted to use the smart features of my new washer and \\ndryer and I thought maybe some of the reviews were exaggerating about \\nprivacy, but they weren\\'t. It requires file access, really? Then you have \\nto create an account, agree to 3 policy/service docs and then it asked for \\nmy birthday! I gave up at this point. No smart features are worth creating \\na full blown advertising profile with sensitive information. Get it \\ntogether LG, you don\\'t need most of that for smart appliance access. If you \\ndo, it\\'s because your app is poorly designed to encapsulate too many \\nthings. Split it up, do whatever, just fix it!.Does not work on Google Nexus 6p. Error says doesn\\'t work on a rooted \\ndevice, but my phone is not rooted, it is stock. Even if my phone was \\nrooted, there is no reason this app shouldn\\'t work on a rooted device. It \\nisn\\'t like I can use it to pirate the LG appliance sitting in my house....Can connect wifi & app to washer no problem but cant download cycles. Over \\nand over it fails download and tells me to try again. Useful feature that \\nsimply doesnt work. Very annoying, garbage app! Not only does it not work \\nbut its a 300mb app!!!.Does not work on a rooted device. Are you kidding me? I am not using this to make a credit card payment, I want to register and program my washer. Had I known of this I\"d have picked a different brand, and next time I will. This restriction is not needed..Why is this app so garbage? The communication is horrible. Super slow \\ncommunication and also app does not always read the appliances I have all \\nthe top of the line LG washer, Dryer, Fridge and the dish washer and yet \\nthey are beautiful pieces but the technology of remote application is \\nhorrible on so many levels. Just make your app better..I would like this more if there was a description of the downloadable \\ncycles. Before choosing the swimwear cycle, I would like to know what \\nexactly that means. What is the heat or speed? I googled a bit and couldn\\'t \\nfind a description of the download cycles, only the cycles on the machine..After 30 min of trying to pair the so-called smart washer with the app via \\nnfc, gave up. Completely useless and non-functional app. LG should be \\nembarrassed even having this app on the store with so many negative and \\npoor reviews..Took a few tries to get it to connect. But now that it\\'s connected it \\noffers some decent diagnostic options, like knowing when the ice bucket is \\nfull or when the water filter needs changing..Does work well on my SGS7 but i havent managed to connect Huawei P10 plus. \\nIt stops at the last stage (step 3) when i try to connect it to LG pm12sp \\naircon..The app is somewhat okay to use. But the notifications are aweful. Why not \\nuse regular notification like all apps? The big notification is really \\nintrusive. All I want is a normal one that goes with the others..has problem with login!! keep saying that my device region dont matches \\nwith settings when i try to login. useless app.Bit slow but at least it works now. Have a new phone and pairing is not an \\nissue anymore..Can\\'t download the extra washing and dryer programs, which was one of the \\nreasons that I choose my twin washing drying machine. Not only....it just \\ndoesn\\'t work at all! No way to connect with the washer/dryer with this app. \\nThe only think this app does is telling me the time left. Edit 21/4/2018: \\ndid all from the beginning, following the LG guide in the link. Nothing \\nchanged. The washer connects to my phone only giving me details on the time \\nleft. I can see the extra programs to download, but during the washing \\ncycle I can\\'t download them (which is normal). Ones the washing cycle is \\nfinished, I can\\'t any more connect washer to phone (yes, the washer is on, \\nthe wifi seems ok). Update 5/2018: after the last update the app seems more \\nstable and the connection between phone and washer better. I gave 3 stars \\ninstead of 1 I gave before because of this.Upon registration, the app says my email is already in use; when I submit \\nmy \"forgot my password\" form, it says it doesn\\'t recognize my email \\naddress. LG FAIL!.DOES NOT support tv purchased 4 months ago. has to be webOS 4 only on \\nlatest 2018 sets. that\\'s very poor! LG should be supporting and updating \\nproducts not shelving them!.Quite basic I\\'m sure it could do more. Alert if there was a problem would \\nbe good. Downloaded and ran fine on my Samsung phone ??.This app is needlessly invasive to start with. Why would it want accesss to my photos, phones calls, and just about everything else on my phone.  LG offers virually NO help or support with the Wifi feature for the air conditioner on their web site. The andriod app is VERY HARD to setup and get running. Part of the problem is the tiny tiny print on the app interface and if it doesnt connect right away you must start all over again.  You will want reading glasses to manage.  The app is also very slow to talk to your router and return to you. LG\\'s web site offers NOTHING to help you.  The product works well, but the wifi doesn\\'t work for it at all.  So much for the IOT feature..App requires way too much information for the functionality it provides. \\nNot sure why the app needs permission to make phone calls, access my media \\nor location. Why does the app also need access to my Google account?.Does not work at all on Samsung S7 or S9...app will not even open. Want \\npermissions to take over your phone too. Brutal app.So far it\\'s great for telling me when a load is done or much time is left. \\nI have not explored all the features so I only gave 4 stars for now..Didn\\'t even get to try it because there\\'s no way I\\'m giving those \\npermissions to an app that only need to program my dryer. I saw the \\ndeveloper\\'s response to why each permission is needed, but don\\'t see the \\nbenefit of those features over giving the app so much access..Its broken. Doesn\\'t recognise my log in. Gave up after 4th time \\nreinstalling it..It does not work with my front loader washing machine ?????? i am very \\ndisappointed from you lg.Won\\'t register the AC on my network. The app is as useless as the broken \\nremote control..Try to register LG account, why they require my date of birth? Also ask too \\nmany permission! What LG want to do with my personal information?.The app and washer/ dryer are set to English but the app displays some \\nthings in English and some in a foreign language..App to fails connect to external appliance with strong wifi ~9/10 times, \\nrendering user to close and restart the app (not even a refresh button is \\nprovided) at least half a dozen times before appliance can be controlled..the app does nothing, it just shows a intro screen and... nothing...Needs too many permissions just to start the app. The app can easily \\nprogrammed to request permission when a feature is actually needed. \\nUninstalled!!.ridiculous privacy requests and why the need to create an account?.Keep on getting an error message. \"SmartThinQ app. Failed execution.\" \\nDeleted and installed it again. No luck..It\\'s really good since we can know the problem by this app.The app just doesn\\'t work..You don\\'t need my location. Reduce the number of permissions you need.Good think so it\\'s life is better now days tech is are life I love LG I \\nhave a tv of LG love it a lot amazing product.Too many permissions, too little functionality.Good smart apps to control & diagnose your LG electronic equipment.not giving ridiculous permissions for an air conditioner.It claimed my pixel XL was rooted. It\\'s not . Can\\'t run uninstalled.Requires too much permission to use..Too many permissions.To many permissions.Not working!!!.Pretty great app, seems to work well and do what it says..Need lot of work in user interface, but was helpful, hoping for more \\nprecise diagnosis in future.Hi, how I can enable mosquito away from smartThinq.magic..!.It\\'s superfatastico.Not working..It is a very good app it help me to save my time.Cannot run on rooted devices ????.Works great can see the room temp and control everything.Works good easy to demo for customers in store.Awesome helped me fix my washer in seconds ??.Excellent app for LG washing machine.It is a good product from LG I loved it.Good for finding fault codes.Very helpful and easy to use.Very usefull.Cool feature.Great app.Im loving it.Quick and efficient.Great????.Great.Great.Great.Best.Cool.Good.The Smart Thinq method of polling back to LG (at least for aircon) means if your internet is down, no wifi control. Also so slow to control because the unit polls for changes rather than having commands pushed. Poor design and poor user experience. I regret buying these devices.Latest update and still have the same issue. It used to work great until \\nthe app was revamped. I used it mostly for the tub clean coach but now when \\nI do so, the NFC Tag On connects, because it does beep, but it doesn\\'t show \\nnumber of washes left. Yes, I\\'ve uninstalled and reinstalled..I used to be able to control the wash cycles remotely. Even with the remote start feature active I cannot. It\\'s like I\\'m locked out. This worked a week ago and now since the update it does not. Very disappointed..I shouldn\\'t have to create an account to use NFC on a dishwasher. Also the \\napp should not need access to make phone calls to upload cycles to a \\ndishwasher... Overly invasive for what it does..It\\'s a quite good and stable app (after connect this app with device :p). I \\nstaggled a bit to connect my AC with this app but I figured it out and this \\napp is awesome and I love it. I think when I shared my location with this \\napp and it gets connected. In a wore it\\'s a good app..Edit: The non standard lock screen notification keeps the phone and screen \\nawake indefinitely, rapidly draining battery. As a result, I\\'ve lowered my \\nrating an additional star. When the app asks if you have a touch panel, \\nthey mean an LCD or OLED type screen, not the touch button type panels. It \\ntook me hours to figure out that my \"touch button panel\" wasn\\'t a \"touch \\npanel\". How about just asking for the model number? The UI needs work in \\ngeneral. It\\'s slow to start up (on a Snapdragon 835 with 6GB RAM and 100Mb \\nWiFi throughput). It would also be nice to be able to customize the \\nnotification sounds for each device, so I could get \"The washer is done\" or \\n\"The dryer is done\", etc. instead of generic notification tones..It worked with my refrigerator for one week. Now it can no longer connect. The WiFi icon on the fridge just flashes. Terrible. I\\'m thinking to return my expensive fridge..I\\'m rating this only one star for now because I can\\'t use this app. I can\\'t \\neven login. When I try to login with my username and email I am greeted \\nwith an error message \"Attention. Device does not match region settings. \\nChange region settings.\" Does this mean my phone is set to the wrong \\nregion? Does this mean my account is set to the wrong region? Does this \\nmean my appliance is in the wrong region? Does this mean my IP geolocation \\nis showing me in the wrong region? This message is so obtuse and unhelpful. \\nAdditionally, I don\\'t know how to take a reasonable action based on the \\nsuggestion of this error. I am an American who speaks English, but I often \\nwork and live overseas. My home base is in the USA, but I spend most of the \\nyear in various locations overseas with corresponding appliances in each \\ncountry. My phone is a Google Pixel 2 XL with Project Fi, which I use \\nbecause of its great international roaming capable SIM card. Each appliance \\nis set to the region where it resides, and would be detected as such by IP \\ngeolocation as well. Does LG expect that I change my phone\\'s region \\nsettings every time I fly to a different country? Does LG expect that I \\nhave a different phone for each country? Does LG expect that I set \\nappliances in other countries to the US region? Does LG expect that I \\ncreate a different account for each region? All of these solutions seem \\nunnecessarily complex and inconvenient, and, combined with the unclear \\nerror which doesn\\'t really tell me where the problem is, deserving of one \\nstar. LG, either fix your system to more easily support users with multiple \\nresidences, or provide a clear solution on how to use SmartThinQ in my \\nsituation. If you can help me with that, then I can actually review the \\nusefulness of this app..The moment i try to turn sleep mode on my washer off using the app so that I can start wsshing.the washer switches off. zzzz doesn\\'t work at all.Uninstalled and reinstalled as suggested. App crashes each time I launch it. No helpful context tip or suggestion. Zero iOT value at all. Disappointing from LG.Cant get this to connect to my washer or dryer. Before its said, the router \\nis right next to my appliances. So disappointed.App does not work. Black screen with red icon comes up, nothing works..Won\\'t run on rooted devices, even though I\\'m not rooted. Utter garbage..I love that I don\\'t have to keep running outside to my laundry room to see \\nif loads are done. I just wait for the app to tell me. Perfect!.?? ???? ??? ????? ???????? ??????? ... ???? ??? ???????? ?? ???? ???? LG ?????? ??????? ?????? ??????? ?????.The app exactly does its work. convenient to use. I can set up swing mode. \\nair direction very easily. It also gives information about electricity \\nconsumption on daily basis..Cannot run on LG V20 stock rom non-root device, the app detect my device is \\nrooted.Doesn\\'t read my NFC tag on the laundry set.After the last update homebot map is not shown any more. Please fix..I love being able to have more freedom to do whatever I need to do..Doesn\\'t support rooted phone..It worked..Pretty good!.Very good.Nice.This upgrade can no longer run on my phone since it is rooted. Why does a laundry app really need such restrictions? Can\\'t they just write an app that interfaces with the system API\\'s. Keep it simple..Cheap hack created to simply say they have an app in order to sell appliances. Bait and switch.  major hassle adding to multi-zone Wi-Fi. Won\\'t work on rooted devices!.Alerts when laundry done, that\\'s about it.  Doesn\\'t work with IFTTT, seems to communicate with Google Home, but rarely reports correct duration left when asking. The app has a AccuWeather widget that shows temp in C¡Æ for users in US. Determines \"home\" based on phones current location which isn\\'t always home. Very slow to open, many instances I could walk downstairs to check the status quicker than opening the app. As others mentioned, many permissions shouldn\\'t be needed.  Only legitimate use at this time is alerts that it\\'s complete..Too many permissions. Why does my dishwasher need to know where my phone \\nis? Even outside that, the blanket \"we can collect and share whatever we \\nwant\" privacy policy is just an invitation for LG to make a profit while \\nyou get spam and junk mail from every appliance maker who buys it from \\nthem. No thanks, controlling my dishwasher from my phone isn\\'t worth that. \\nEDIT - LG says they need all those permissions for \"support\". Ok, do like \\nEVERY OTHER app and ask when appropriate, don\\'t close the app at load when \\nI tell you to piss off. You DO NOT need to know all that info just so I can \\nview my dishwasher\\'s status. Either you\\'re lying about what you do with it, \\nor you have some seriously unqualified devs..Not a single image would load.  Broken image icon for every one.  No way to even select my network.  Amateur issues that I would never expect from LG and ridiculous considering I spent $1600 on their \"smart\" washer dryer set.  Removed app.  Come on LG..Useless and doesn\\'t work. Really needs some serious updating. Too many permissions. IOT equipment need security and functionality.Complete garage app from lg again you think a big company like this could get a simple remote app right it\\'s super slow and can\\'t even link my air conditioner just freezes on last step beeping left it for 10min then had to cancel it before it drove me crazy at less with the last app it would link.Acess my phone calls, media etc PLUS log in via email or FB!!??  What the deuce....data mining= no thanks!!!.My phone isn\\'t rooted (yet) and the app thinks it is.  There is no reason for this app not to work on a rooted phone.  I think this is totally arbitrary..so been forced to use this instead of LG laundry app and what a stinking lump of excrement it is. not only does it require 5.5x more storage and unusual permission requests but upon launch does nothing except show a blank white screen.I really hate as that require broad permissions.  Apps should be written so that it uses what it has.  I was looking forward to using this app..I spent money on a dryer with this function only to find out it lools like it\\'s used to data mine, not help with my laundry. I was told I would be downloading a laundry app for my dryer. The store people were very mistaken. This wants access to my whole phone. Why? I can\\'t even install it on a device like my tablet, because it\\'s rooted. This seems scamish? Shame on you LG..Brand new pixel 2xl, not rooted, but LG app will not run because it thinks phone is rooted.  Perhaps should return $4000 fridge if LG can\\'t write a competent app.....App is very slow. Could not get past terms screen (Invalid Terms!). Wants access to far too much on phone without any explanation of why. Deleting app.Stupid app in my opinion .... trying to connect the washing machine .... needs direct access to the router with no obsticles .... who the hell has there router in the laundry??? Or their washing machine in the livingroom ????.Totally useless piece of software. Dear LG, why do you waste your and your customers time creating \\'masterpieces\\' like this?.Terrible app. Doesn\\'t consider that in some cases the functions required for the app to work is already broken, so it can\\'t even register the product or diagnose at all. Uninstalled.Useless app. It says it can\\'t run on a rooted device, but my phone isn\\'t rooted. My phone is impossible to root because of Samsung\\'s locked bootloader. This app is horrible..I already have an account and I can\\'t get past the terms and privacy screen. Invalid term type? Really?.App doesn\\'t open. Says \"cannot run on rooted device\". My device isn\\'t rooted. It\\'s weird that a major tech company like LG cannot build apps as well as some homeless people.Well at least it tells me why it won\\'t open now.  Can\\'t run on rooted devices.  How useless..Requires location, phone, and access to photos just to open the app. Then it requires you to log in with google or Facebook. Why does setting a laundry timer require so much of my information?.Why you dont have Living option (Vacum Cleaner) in app. I just get one vacum cleaner and i can\\'t find option in app for registration. There is only options for another Lg products..4 months later still no notifications. USELESS GARBAGE!!! Notifications don\\'t work at all on Android 8.0 or 8.1 and half the time you open the app it\\'s just gray..I have a washing machine and this is a great reminder when it\\'s finished resulting in fresher cloths since they\\'re rarely forgotten..Does not work. What a piece of junk. Slow, will not run most of the time..Does not do what it\\'s suppose to do.  I can\\'t get it to work with my dryer..Make calls? Access location and media? Must be kidding. Uninstalled right away..Tried for over an hour to connect my appliances to my device. Worthless app so uninstalling it.I installed it. It asked to manage my phone calls. I uninstalled it..Can\\'t run on a rooted device? Reply to the reply: you\\'re the first app on \\nthe planet to do that...Hice la conexi?n hacia mi lavadora, pero aparecen tags como \"@WM_MX_OPTION_REMOTE_START_W\"  d?nde deber?a ir el texto, por lo cual la app se hace inentendible..Won\\'t open. Just stops on a white screen..¬¯¬Ö ¬Þ¬à¬Ø¬å ¬Õ¬à¬Õ¬Ñ¬ä¬Ú ¬á¬à¬ã¬å¬Õ¬à¬Þ¬Ú¬Û¬ß¬å ¬Þ¬Ñ¬ê¬Ú¬ß¬å - ¬ä¬Ñ¬Ü¬à? ¬à¬á¬è?? ¬ß¬Ö¬Þ¬Ñ ¬å ¬ã¬á¬Ú¬ã¬Ü¬å ¬Ó ¬å¬Ü¬â¬Ñ?¬ß¬ã¬î¬Ü?¬Û ¬Ó¬Ö¬â¬ã?? (¬á¬â¬à ?¬ß¬ê? ¬Þ¬à¬Ó¬Ú/¬â¬Ö¬Ô?¬à¬ß¬Ú - ¬ß¬Ö ¬Ù¬ß¬Ñ¬ð)..Asks too many permissions. Spyware..The wather info isn\\'t load, i\\'ve entered location in the search result list.Useful app, but ask for too many permission.Too slow, continuously disconecting.\"Cannot run on rooted device.\" Okay then, one star it is then..App does not allow to connect to hombot lg.Would be nice if it actually worked with google home.Its a fake app.Does not start.OK so now the app works great again. Love it.Doesn\\'t work.Mode not working????.bad.good.I downloaded this app and can\\'t not get my dishwasher to connect with it. It doesn\\'t even give a message that it didn\\'t connect just sat there in the connecting screen for 10 mins. I looked like an idiot trying to connect.The fact that this app refuses to run on a rooted device is ridiculous. I have the right to do as I wish with my phone. I\\'ve loved every LG device I\\'ve ever had, but by doing this, you\\'ve lost a customer for good..*update: it now says that the app won\\'t run on a rooted device. Well, my phone is NOT rooted; even did a sanity check by installing Root Checker and verified that it isn\\'t rooted.   App doesn\\'t even open on Galaxy S7.I can\\'t for the life of me get my new LG dishwasher to pair with my Samsung S8+.  I was exticed to use the smart app, but guess this only works with older phones. Junk.Why does an app to program a washing machine want access to my location, contacts and be able to place phone calls.  If you want your privacy completely invaded, this is the perfect app for you..Closes saying \"cannot run rooted device\". My phone is not rooted and never has been. Come on LG, get your act together. This is stupid, fix your app.Why do you want to access my phone calls  Why do you want to access my pictures folders  Why in the hell do you want to use my GPS  You need to explain yourself before people are going to allow you to access their personal information the designer this app is an idiot.First, it doesn\\'t work. Secondly, unless it s going to fold my clothes and put them away what is the point? Just because an app can be created, doesn\\'t mean it should..Won\\'t run on a rooted device? My device isn\\'t rooted! Stock Google Pixel 1. Stop unnecessarily restricting your app from users..Does not work at all, way to go LG I guess they do not test products before selling them.Cannot use with android6.0.1 but work well with my mom\\'s mobile android version 4.4.1.!!!  what should I do?.Will not work unless you give it permissions for location, phone and storage. I wonder why it needs location and phone to be able to read the tag!.This is the worst app ever created. Because of it I will never buy anything from LG again..not working at all, not sure its washer/dry issue or app. the nfc tagging not work.App only connected to refrigerator once and indicated no problems while the compressor quit working and food was spoiling..My device is never rooted, but app stop working with message \"can not run on a rooted device\"!.Any chance you can change the app so it can be relocated to an SD card from internal storage? - 12/3/2018 I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever get a reply..Will not even open app. Useless.App registration of product was awesome. App notifications of laundry done is awesome. Wish downloaded washing made more sense or that customization of a load with app was easy and doable..App is too slow, other brand clima apps are more fast.Won\\'t run on a rooted device, rubbish..Took me 45 seconds to connect my LG portable ac unit! Read the directions!.Can\\'t create an account, TOS denies me Everytime..Couldn\\'t find a worse company like this.????? ???????????????? ?????? ???? ????? ?????????.A bit hard to connect.Work with my washer as advertised.After the latest update, this app will no longer open on Samsung Galaxy S8+  even after clearing data and uninstalling then reinstalling. I wish I could give it a 0... Seems others with galaxy s8 and s8+ are having the same issue. Update:  this app will not run on rooted devices.  Compete disappointment..Very slow app. Used for washer. Takes 5-10 minutes to start and makes user read it\\'s logo. If you do not watch then this app can disappear with a short notice on something such as \"the washer is off\" and you have to press ok to continue, if you miss it the app will stop. No extra benefit as the down loadable cycles only add names. The options are very similar to one of existing cycle. You cannot create your own cycle also. Once you review all of them then you will know that you don\\'t need a download and probably this app also..Why would LG make a washer / dryer combo without a separate dryer function? With so many functions you never use, they could not fit this one in as a standard function in their menu.  The only reason I installed  this app was so I could download a dryer only function to the machine.  Deleting app now as it has unreasonable permissions (wanting access to make phonecalls and monitor my calls. No reason for this except blatant marketing).Connects to my LG kitchen appliances just fine. Finicky on my laundry. My fridge was being difficult, but after unplugging it for 10 seconds, it connected to the app..New \"update\" takes even longer to start than the previous version. This app needs a complete rewrite with a focus on usability and user privacy (why does LG need to know my  location to turn on my AC? (Answer: It doesn\\'t, it\\'s just spying).Doesn\\'t open.  Tap icon, screen blinks, and goes back to previous screen.  Tried uninstalling/reinstalling already.  Edit: now it says: Cannot run on a rooted device, but my device is not rooted..De volgende twee dingen mis ik. Ik kan niet per dag aangeven wanneer mijn stofzuiger z\\'n ding moet doen. Kan alleen daily aangeven. Punt twee is dat het heel mooi zijn om het te laten integreren met bijvoorbeeld Home-assitant. Dit maakt het product veel aantrekkelijker dan het nu is. Aangezien de concurrenten daar al verder mee zijn. Graag improven..Cannot connect - registration failed for both washer and dryer. Tried everything I can think of and researched for solution online to no avail. Never been so frustrated with an app, was looking forward to using it with my new washer/dryer..Doesn\\'t work at all! Just get a message \"check network connection and try again\". Having been trying for several days now since taking delivery of my new washing machine :(.App does not work on Google pixel says phone is rooted?  My phone is not rooted but why would they care..Cannot run on a rooted device (bad it is not rooted). It\\'s the third phone I try. I didn\\'t imagine that LG was so poor in technology. Will try other brand in the future.Not enough options  I would like a small load cycle for more than a 3 pound load.The app does not NFC connect to the washing machine on my Samsung GS7, model SM-G930V. NFC works on the phone and it connects to the washer with an ancient Kyocera phone in the house..I\\'m using FC1207s3w, and it has wifi built in. But it doesnt have NFCtagOn. So whats the use of it? I done even find the wifi password anywhere on the machine..  i\\'m sure it would be great if I could find the wifi password...I gave up waiting for it to boot up. I never got a chance to try it..App won\\'t open. Says \"Cannot run on rooted device\" when I\\'ve never rooted..Didn\\'t open. Edit: New version says it can\\'t run on a rooted device. Mine is not..Google home support should really exist outside of USA..Can\\'t even register to product by using NFC..wasting time to try to connect the app. Going to uninstall it.Hey  somebody please Help !!!! I bought a Lg f10c3ldp2 From Dubai and using in Lahore Pakistan.  Used this couple of time then it stops working when I start the machine lights starts blinking and machine create sound . Like, ton ton ton   I Called LG center In Lahore since it\\'s bought from Dubai it\\'s warranty can\\'t be claimed here . But In Lahore they don\\'t have any good technician they sent me  a guy who checked machine for 10 seconds and asked me to change Door lock which he told worth is 6000 pkr. And Charged 600 Pkr for visting.  & when I changed door lock same guy said it\\'s panel fault you have to change its panel which worth 15000 pkr.    Now tell me guys what should I Do  ???       Help. ...!!!!!!.UX needs improvement..Doesn\\'t read NFC.Waste of time.It\\'s fine. Used for LG washer and dryer. Sends notifications when cycles are done, which is all I wanted. Users who post that they don\\'t like to turn on machine first are true, but be serious, you\\'re physically in front of the machine putting in clothes. Is it that hard to turn on the machine so you can remotely start the thing later?.Still one star. I have a washer dryer combo and cannot get it to connect to my app. I spent over a half hour with LG customer service and tried about 10 times. Each time it would show it\\'s connecting and getting info, then it would show connection failure stating I wasn\\'t entering my correct password to my modem which I know I was.  Right now 1 star. The app tells me to press and hold the wifi / wifi connect until the connect icon starts to blink. Can you please tell me where the heck to find the wifi connect on my LG wt7200cw washer? I looked everywhere online and there\\'s nothing that tells me how to find this or how to connect my washer to this app.Another version of this app that force closes.  You should remove the word \"smart\" from it\\'s name,  there is nothing smart about it or the people who make it.  And I still can\\'t use all of my washing machine\\'s functions although I paid for the whole package. I don\\'t understand how Google allows such an app here when most people can\\'t use it.  And I don\\'t understand how a company such as LG treats it\\'s customers this way by being incapable of writing a damn working app..Useless. You have to turn on the washer and dryer manually to use this REMOTE app which is ridiculous.  It would be like having smart lights that you can only operate remotely once you manually switch them on.... EVERY TIME you use them. Why wouldn\\'t the remote stay on and the washer dryer stay connected to WiFi when asleep like EVERY OTHER SMART APPLIANCE ON THE MARKET? Embarrassingly terrible smart applicancea and app..After reading all these reviews I didn\\'t even bother to download just to get a simple text that the laundry is done.... And every LG response is that same copy and paste BS that\\'s full of bad Grammer the kind you find  in the cheapest made in China product manuals with every person still having the same problems.The app is asking me to press WiFi Reset in the WiFi Menu, after selecting More Settings under the Settings button.  I don\\'t have any of these buttons or menus, they don\\'t exist anywhere.  I do have a twin wash as in the picture, I do not have a jog dial. The manual has nothing on it, It mentions a gateway requirement....  Does it want me to use the app to connect? While the app wants me to use the settings menu on the machine? Come on! Life was good.   Ooooh, stupid me! Of course! Got it connected! Simple really, just don\\'t follow the instructions.  1.Answer no when they show a picture of your machine. 2. No matter what they ask you to press, like a boss, just press and hold the Delayed End button until the WiFi icon starts to blink. 3. Wait a few and check your app, cool app by the way.   2 more stars.The app never opened after installation. A brand new washer and already one major feature cannot be used. That is utterly ridiculous. I want a full refund and I\\'m buying a whirlpool.It does work with my brand new WM3770 washer. But NFC tap is really hard to find the spot. Other than download a new cycle, not seeing other useful function. If the only communication is NFC tap, I don\\'t see how remote is needed..You can\\'t turn Washing Machine ON! ?? You call this a Smart App? Total Fail. Zero stars. You people suck! Why do you need to access my files ??, photos and location? You are in violation of The Privacy Act in USA ????!  Uninstall this garbage at once!.Closes if you don\\'t grant access to phone calls, storage and location or any one of those alone. Errr.. sorry LG, poor show, this will make me think twice when buying future products....I don\\'t get it. My Air Con control app worked just fine. Now you want me to install this, want more personal details than I care to give just to turn on a freaking air con on the way home. Want more perrmissions to my phone than required. Crazy. Stop making thinks so difficult and invasive.  Uninstall is the only solution I\\'m happy with. So long to turning my air con on when away from home. Goodbye L.G..Slow (takes 3-5 seconds per button press to refresh and takes multiple button presses to log in, load the air conditioner and turn it on). Also, doesn\\'t support Google home assistant integration outside the US (i.e Australia) - product registration fails otherwise..This is actually qiute a garbage. Well done LG! A spyware and other scam apps needs les permition than this. If I ever wanted to call your support I would do it my self, I not going to give your app unrestricted permitios to make calls when ever you get want, specially when the phone is locked. When I want to install update, I will make sure I can my self, I would never give permitions to your app to upload any and all of my files to anywhere! Are you completly nuts?!?.Won\\'t open after update. Used to work fine. Updated again and same issue. Updated again to 1.9.24 and still force close.  Here\\'s the funny part. This is on my LG G3 phone!  Another update to 1.9.28. Still force closes. Tried installing on my old Samsung S4 running android 5.0 and same thing. Start the app, it attempts to open with a black screen and then immediately kicks you back out. No error messages or anything so I have nothing to send you..Still not working, I was waiting for the update but i think I\\'ll give it back. On my wash and dry, simply doesn\\'t connect. Wifi icon on the panel blinks till it stop with a product registration error :(.Atrocious to use. Spent half an hr in front of the machine trying to switch functions but it kept jumping back to the previous one I\\'d attempted to \"download\". Pity, it could have been so good..The Smart ThinQ button on the refrigerator isn\\'t linking to my phone. I\\'ve turned on the NFC on my phone, pressed the phone against the logo on the fridge and NOTHING is happening. I even checked the location of the NFC antenna on my phone to make sure the connection would work. Stupid app... don\\'t waste your time like I did..The app doesn\\'t open! It\\'s 90 mb of useless download. I bought an appliance that I can\\'t use because of some kids that have no knowledge about Android development..Won\\'t Open! Hasn\\'t in months. LG fire your app developer yesterday! This is unacceptable. Update: If your phone is rooted...with magisk go to magisk hide and select this app, reboot and it will work..My old review still holds:  The old LG Laundry app was much better.  This new app hardly does anything.  The old app had stain removal and specific laundry type suggestions which i finally wanted to use and now thats gone. This app is almost useless..it\\'s not working on Android 7/8, iOS 11.X but working with Android 6. I have spent several hours to find out what\\'s wrong with it with several phones with different OS including borrowing phone from my friends... sad..   Always getting registration failed and try again message even though my front load was registered successfully...  Never expect such outdated applications from LG.. Please do the needful and update the apps...Hot garbage. Crashes repeatedly. Takes 2 mins to open on a Pixel XL. Incredibly fragile, pressing buttons too fast and poorly translated error messages flash up. Unregistering an account doesn\\'t work. Please bring the old LG Smart AC app back, or open up the API so that someone can write a better app..When I connected to my washing machine f2j7hm1w and after entering the password of wifi. It says product registed. But after that product writes connecting and fails. So I could not download the required programs..If there is lower than one star i will give... app tells me the selected product (WS1910HXM)  is not supported by SmartThinQ..Crashing on Honor 6x (Chipset-Kirrin 655).. Pls fix it.. It used to work upto 1.9.1... Simply failing to work from 1.9.2  Fix this useless thing.Useless. They\\'re trying to market themselves as being tech savvy and compatible with the latest market trend but this app fails. The app won\\'t notify me when my washer load is done and it won\\'t successfully allow my Google Home to communicate with it either. Get it together LG....No matter what I do my minisplit will not register with this app.  It fails at different points but never finishes.  If the installer doesn\\'t get it working next week they are ripping it out and replacing it with a Mitsubishi heat pump.  And why does the app need access to my calling data? I should have listened-buy a Mitsubishi..I\\'m giving this two stars because it does work on my Samsung Galaxy S8, but it is otherwise about as worthless as apps get. I can\\'t think of anything useful to do with it, and I will probably delete it. Apparently \"smart\" appliances are still being paired with \"dumb\" apps..Another update: Saw that there was a recent bugfix so I figured I\\'d try again. Same still FCs immediately. There was a version that worked but not since. Oh well, I\\'m glad I didn\\'t buy my washing machine because of an app like some people??  Update again:Still force closing immediately    Update: Still FC\\'s immediately.  Also, I saw somebody complaining that they bought  their washer and dryer because of the app. How stupid are you? Buy a WASHING MACHINE for how well it washes or the reliability, hell even just because you like the design. To purchase anything because of an app is just dumb and you get what you deserve..This app is a total joke do not download it. It asks you for your birthday and then tells you you do not comply with their terms of service. I must be too old or too young to own a dishwasher. At least I know that I\\'m old enough to know how to uninstall this app now.Installed on a Google Pixel XL running Android 8.1.0 and it force closes immediately when trying to open. I uninstalled and reinstalled to no avail. Total failure..BS app, wants to know way too much about you before you can get started.... FB, you can location, access to make calls, and modify media, to date of birth and agree to three separate terms... Duk Off..App sucks, crashes immediately. Tech support who responds to poor ratings is equally incompetent as they continue to request emailed screenshots of an app that shuts down the INSTANT you touch the icon. I\\'m sure a screenshot of my app page emailed to them will fix everything.....NOT.  Old version is also gone, of course..The app works perfectly, as designed.  The trouble is with the instructions. Both the manual that came with my washer and the online manual are completely wrong.    Personally I had little trouble getting it going..Push notifications don\\'t work! I\\'ll get a notification of cycle finish anywhere between 12 and 24 hours later... often in the middle of the night while sleeping! Even after I turned off the push notifications in the app it continues to notify me at annoying hours even after I\\'ve put the laundry away. So now I went into the phone battery and prioritized this app for notifications and still it does not work. So I turned it all off in the app again and now also turned off in my cell app notifications. Stupid app. Worked the first week and now it\\'s garbage! Come on LG... you should know how to fix this!.This app was uninstalled within 5 minutes. To many permissions (no good reason for location to be shared), plus it was over 250 MB by the time I got to the point of logging in. Don\\'t waste your time..So smart it needs access to location, phone and files or it won\\'t open. Invasive rubbish..Two stars because I\\'m hopeful for the necessary improvements. Right now the app deserves one: SmartThinQ is not compatible with Amazon Alexa. The app itself doesn\\'t actually do anything.  Pairing my appliance to my phone (Huawei Mate 9) is a pointless exercise. Want to turn the oven on and set the temperature? Walk to the oven and fiddle around for the NFC spot. How about changing settings? Same pointless thing. The app doesn\\'t monitor the oven, nor does it send notifications. I reckon the crux of the problem is that there seems to be no way for the app or the appliance to connect to my WI-Fi. For what it does (which is nothing), it asks a LOT of permissions. Again, I\\'m hopeful that sometime soon the app will actually minimally function..So it took a couple of weeks and a few chats/phone calls/emails to finally get this app communicating with my washing machine lol.. but I\\'m hooked up now so you can start collecting my data ;) I won\\'t ever be using the app to remotely start my washing machine haha but as a reward for manufacturing a washer that allows me to choose the water temp, depth, cycle intensity, soak, extra rinse, rinse only, rinse speed and more! I will allow you to get some stats on how the washer is used :D Thanks..Download successfully, but failed to load application on Android v7.0. Guess what phone this is crashing on LG? It\\'s your LG G5 phone that I\\'m using, wow! This application really needs to be fix LG..I don\\'t understand the point of having remote start if you have to push the button every time you turn the machine on should the machine not pretty much just stay on at all times this just doesn\\'t make sense.Needs access to make phone calls and check the status of my phone. Needs access to determine my exact location of my phone even when app isn\\'t running and I\\'m not home. What the hell?.Doesn\\'t work with Google Home! In Australia, even though the app shows in the google home list of connectable things. One of the main reasons I bought the LG air conditioners, so pretty disappointed. The app is ok, but so slow..Not developed with the care LG claims it takes to make it\\'s products. Did not even help diagnose my refrigerator no cooling issue using SDS. No info on the problem on a new fridge makes it pointless to have the app..LG, you should be embarrassed by the user experience in this app. After registering new products on the web, I went ahead and created an account on the web. Then after downloading this app, I tried to login using the credentials I created for registration. Did that work? NO. I had to create a separate account, which does not recognize all the data previously entered. So now I have two LG customer accounts, WITH IDENTICAL CREDENTIALS AND INFORMATION, to access the full feature set of what I\\'ve purchased. It\\'s absurd to have to register to use an app to access devices only on my own LAN, but it\\'s doubly absurd to have to register twice through the same company, and it\\'s downright terrible that there is no internal data sharing at LG. I only hope that the hardware experience is better than the software, this does not present a good picture of how LG thinks out how its customers engage with the brand..App won\\'t even start (One Plus 3) for a washer+dryer. I\\'m glad I didn\\'t purchase the more expensive wifi version and will definetly avoid getting a dishwasher based on this feature..UPDATE: Originally I left a 1 star review. In May 2017 when I originally purchased the machine I couldn\\'t get the phone to connect via the tab at all. It connected with other appliances so I knew it wasn\\'t an nfc issue with my smartphone. Fed up of having to manipulate cycles for my wools (surprising it isn\\'t a standard option anyway) I decided to give it another go. I downloaded the app again and then when it came to pairing with the phone it was instant (I placed it in the same place as last time so defo wasn\\'t me). Clearly the developers have listened to customers and updated the app. I found a wool cycle and downloaded it, phone didn\\'t even have to be right on top of the machine either just hovering nearby, and the cycle reset on the washer and was ready to go. This is exactly what I wanted so you deserve the newly updated 5 star rating guys ??  I\\'m sure there are other features too but this was my bug bear not getting it connect and it\\'s now fixed so I\\'m looking forward to seeing what other features I can use :).App needs fixing - simply crashes when trying to open. My phone is not rooted so should not be an issue.  I will update review if you can get an update out to fix this.  In response to your reply - I downloaded the app, click on the icon, the app flashes up then crashes. I don\\'t know what more to say. Will uninstall & just use the buttons on the front of my new washing machine..LG, someone before me posted a question about why your app needs access to way too much information - IE pictures, storage, phone, etc - in order to turn the app on.  Your response, pasted below, is grossly inadequate.    \"LG Electronics, Inc. February 8, 2018 Dear.Jamie I\\'m sorry for the trouble. About permission, we don\\'t collect any information. And we\\'re in progress of developing the new version that explain the reason why the app need the permission. Please wait.. And I\\'m sorry again.\"  The answer is that your developers are lazy.  There is NO reason that your app needs all this access simply to download cycles and remotely control the machines.  The only reason you\\'d ever need that is for troubleshooting.  I know it makes life easier for your devs to make it mandatory instead of actually developing the app in such a way to make it less intrusive, but that\\'s what they get paid to do.  Remove that requirement and you\\'ll have a fair number of happier customers.  Further, I agree that the app, so far anyway, seems fairly useless for anything beyond downloading cycles.  Perhaps when I have a problem that needs to be troubleshot remotely I\\'ll find it useful, but for now, no..Last update broke the app. Will not even open even after uninstalling and reinstalling :\\'(.SO MANY BUGS ??????N TOO MUCH TIME TAKING 2 OPEN THE APP??????. ALSO NOT USER FRNDLY FOR SENIOR CITIZENS ??????.This app won\\'t work on my brand new LG phone. Love LG\\'s phones but disappointed with their apps....crash!! couldn\\'t even open it. downloaded it twice. crashed!!!.Basicly the only thing you can do with the app is push start button remotely and change downloadable program on the machine. Crashes when another user is connected. It is an enormous app from the ages of dinosaurus..Why not it is working with WiFi and another problem is that place phone too close to the tap on function, it doesnt mean it\\'s remote control app, and if need a function you have to download a separate cycle of each function after that sometime it will work or sometime not LG sucks.Requires too many invasive permissions. I installed it to see what it did for my LG appliances, yet it requires access to files, my GPS location and my phone just to run. Too much! Denied the permissions and now I am deleting the app..Its allways worked fine with my phone and Centum lg washer. I would like to know why though you cant download the 1 hour wash program that only shows up in the additional program list if you manually search for it..Cannot get passed terms and conditions. Phone is not rooted. Everything required installed and updated. It says something doesn\\'t comply with your terms... Looking at all of the other ratings, I don\\'t have much faith....I download it.. i press it to start... it crashes.. simple as that..Annoying tip overlay. App got stuck setting up by dishwasher to the WiFi..Why does this app need permission to my photos, videos, call and messages?  Unless you provide the information you can\\'t use the app.  No thank you.   Total invasion..I installed the app to diagnose my washing machine,but it force closed as soon as I tried to open it.After looking through the reviews,I noticed the dev told somebody that the app will not work on rooted devices.I understand blocking rooted devices in games because of cheaters,but what is the logical purpose of blocking a washing machine app?.The app does not respond. Keep loading non stop. Please fix it..This Apps work fine on my 2 in 1 Washer and Dryer. If it allow us to change the custom setting on cycle (such as temperature and dry), then it would be much more convenience.Doesn\\'t work.  Will check later to see if updates get released.The app doesn\\'t work at all. I start the app, it shows a black screen for one sec, then returns to the previous screen. Samsung S8, Android 7, not rooted..Useless apps. Not working with the new LG washine machine i bought... are sure this apps is working?.I thought I could really customize my washer with this. I guess I can only do that if I want to wash a small load. Perhaps I\\'ll find it more useful in the future, but for now it\\'s a real disappointment..My Samsung Galaxy Note 4 running android 6.0.1 with NFC turned on could not connect with my LG washer 3770H*A.  Please provide better instructions or fix the app.Very poor app. Just wasted 20 minutes trying to connect my washing machine with this useless Tag On..Absolutely useless despite over 90 MB of size! Never think of installing it..Why do you need access to phone calls , msg, gallery!!.Edit: STILL NOT WORKING, STILL NO SUPPORT FROM LG! THIS APP DOESN\\'T OPEN it FORCE CLOSES! Android 6 & Android 4+ devices. RIDICULOUS. - Feb 17th.   Like this comment so we can get some support rather than an automated answer, the highest rated comment which shows first says it\\'s all fine, which it clearly isn\\'t. Many people having issues and an app rating of 2! Seriously LG???  Original post:  Just bought an LG Titan washing machine with apparently Smart Thinq technology. Doesn\\'t work at all, the app immediately closes as soon as you try to open it, using a clean Honor 6x android 6 install, same as I see another person in comments using (without success too) Not rooted so that isn\\'t the problem. Found an earlier version of the app, v1.8 which actually shows the app loading screen but then notifies of an update to 1.92 and won\\'t continue further without updating, so catch 22. Really annoyed as this was part of the reason for buying this machine. Please fix this app else I\\'ll be switching to a Samsung machine. Unacceptable.  Edit: As already stated, the app simply won\\'t open. Tried via my Honor 6x phone running Android 6.0 Emui 4.1.3 Kirin 655. My Samsung Tab running Android 4.4, none of the devices are rooted. The app flashes a white screen and promptly disappears, refusing to run. Earlier versions actually start to load but then informs of an update and won\\'t continue until updating to the latest version, which obviously doesn\\'t work..Sadly app doesn\\'t work on ROOTED devices But the tech. Support is so great.How can I customize my own programs for a wash/dry combi????  I woud like to have a feature to combine programs in the app line blanket+dry( limit 8kg washing) Without Manuel setup.Dudes, for 2-3 months app still crashing because loading images cannot be found in /images. Really?.LoL you can\\'t turn the machine\\'s on from the app...what\\'s the point of me walking up the Washer and dryers to turn them on than walking away to use the app... LMAO.Does not work with Google WiFi. I cannot get the app to register my washer and dryer..US only? Really? Cannot use with Google Assistant outside the US. Garbage product, returning this.Force closes at start. Yes, my phone is rooted. 80mb is ridiculous..Useless app. Will not open on rooted devices..Cannot download a cycle. Remote start works. End of load notification works. The app is worthless and useless..Installation instructions could be clarified a bit better. Make sure your register your device with LG prior to attempting to get this app to work.  Once you\\'ve done that, the app works as advertised..What can i do if i cant enable android system webview app  My software is nougat and chrome now disabled system web view in android nougat So everytime i try to open ur app it takes very long time loading  Then no network connection  What can i do as u adviced to update system web view to latest version and i m not able to control this app as chrome disabled it in nougat.Slow and poor quality app. Why\\'s that when they have phone division?.Won\\'t open my pixel. Had the same issue on my Samsung. Not impressed.No good app. Won\\'t connect to my new electric range.Why must i grant permission to phone calls, storage and location.Excited to try SmartThinQ with my new washer. Downloaded the app but it does not open. Tried uninstalling and installing multiple times, but no joy. :(.I am in Canada.  How do I get the display to read in Celsius? The dashboard for my fridge says C but the temperatures are actually reading the temperature in F..Using with AC. Very long loading. Every change in settings is sent to AC which takes 4-5 sec and blocks user activity. Takes ages to set up the AC. Also app is not loading AC data after recent update..Crashes even after uninstall/reinstall multiple times..i cannot get into the app i downloaded it for my new fridge and it wont even open?????.Great app concept, but it needs a more robust platform on this app and less complicated and with LESS PERMISSIONS.Dreadful application, avoid LG at all costs.Limited functionality. Only interesting feature (power consumption) hidden under menus..Useless app doesnt even open.Does not start at all on Android 8.0.I cant start this app on Galaxy S8+ Nougat. It auto force quit after start all the time..It won\\'t allow me to download cycles or show how much time is remaining on either washer or dryer..Waste of time. Not solving problem..I can never upgrade my washer/dryer as the update will only go up to 70%...every time!!!.Need too many permissions for what it\\'s supposed to do..The app only displays temperature in F even though the fridge is set up to Celsius.Worst \"smart\" app ever created..This app doesn\\'t open on a OnePlus 3 running default operating system..Continuous constant crashing!.This app crashes completely on android 8 ..Cant open on my phone s7edge os noughat.. please fix ASAP.Too many permissions, requires account....Crashes on load. Useless.The refrigerator is not accepting my wifi password.Only works on phones not on any of our tablets..Does not work..Cannot open app on phone..This app won\\'t open on my android 8 devices which makes it useless !.The app doesn\\'t run on my phone.Cant run on a rooted device..I can not open app..The app is works as expected..Did not launch at all.App won\\'t even open.Google Nexus 6, can\\'t even run it! Why??.Can\\'t open app.Can even log in.Lg washing machine is no 1 worst product.Nice app.. But TV also need to integrate.Can\\'t start.Force closed.Crash on start.Lg sux.Waste of time.failed to start.Doesn\\'t even start. Now what?.Could be useful. Force close issue..Great.Fantastic.I get repeated false alerts that \"Drying is complete\" despite the dryer being disconnected and not even running!  Concerned this is a security risk.  What exactly is being monitored?  Is it reporting on someone else?  I have disabled the WiFi and blocked the appliance from the network as an additional security measure..I\\'ve seen some bad apps in my day, but this could probably win an award for the most completely dysfunctional and worthless app ever released. Every touch disables the app completely, so it is impossible to register or use the app for anything but an exercise in enduring aggravation. That being the case, one has to question the wisdom of buying any of their appliances or other products. They clearly do not care about or understand the first thing about quality. What a terrible joke..LG automatically download an upgrade to our Smart ThinQ washer and after it the machine doesn\\'t work anymore. After several weeks of complaints the factory never responded for the damage. We don\\'t recommend this Application, the LG product  support is pretty bad..This app hasn\\'t worked once!! I cannot stress how useless the app is. My remote start is on and the app says it\\'s off. I can\\'t use the downloaded cycles since it won\\'t remote start. I am disgusted that I spent almost $2000 for this special washer to have the special features non useable!!! SERIOUSLY, the whole point of having a remote start is so that if you forget to start your load you can start it from your phone right? Nope, have to plan on using remote start in advance and turn the machine to that setting and then the machine turns itself off if you don\\'t start it within a certain time frame. So what\\'s the point of remote start?!?! And when is doesn\\'t work even when it\\'s on.....unbelievable.Fastest crash ever. Won\\'t even show a splash screen.  I would withdraw this app from Google Play and do a complete rewrite. With so many bad reviews it\\'s doing more harm to LG\\'s public image than not being available at all.  And this the first review I\\'ve ever felt compelled to post after using smartphones for 8 years. Congrats LG..The Tag On feature only works well on my washer, the dryer hardly connects. This is likely more of an issue with the appliance than the app. In terms of the app, it works but leaves a lot to be desired. It\\'d be great to see the cycle settings without having to download them. It\\'d also be great to create your own cycles..Why the hell do I have to create an LG account to control an air-conditioner I already purchased?  I have no intention of signing up to anything or giving my details to anyone just to get the advertised functionality of my device. Now time to uninstall this invasive rubbish, won\\'t be buying LG in future..App is slow, clunky, and ineffective. Very difficult to pair to appliances. If you don\\'t let it have access to your phone calls, the entire app shuts down. Really doesn\\'t do anything. Was decent 4 months ago when it kinda worked, now it\\'s useless..Used to work. Now I cannot connect my LG refrigerator. App says it may take more than 3 minutes. I have tried dozens of times and waited over 30 minutes in some cases with no luck. Useless. Please fix it.Just got an LG washer and wanted to use the nfc smart feature, but the app doesn\\'t even open.  I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling and it didn\\'t fix it.  I have tried installing older versions but same issue.   It work on my iPhone but it doesn\\'t let you download cycles.  What is going on LG!!!!?.I was able to connect refrigerator but could never get washer or dryer to connect. Very dissatisfied! I tried and tried. I uninstalled and reinstalled but no go. Using Samsung Galaxy 7 edge and even took cover off..When trying to log in the app tells me my credentials are incorrect, yet when I attempt a password reset (using same password) it tells me that I can\\'t reset it to what the password currently is....what? Yes I could try to reset it to something different, but considering the other reviews I\\'m not inclined to waste my time. Unfortunately, I must rate it as \"unusable\" until LG has demonstrated  the ability and willingness to take its product quality and customer perceptions seriously..It really adds to washer. It adds ?? more useless programs. I can\\'t design my own progrmms and the ones it has, have nothing to do with reality. I want my towels clean and dry but there\\'s no programm for that, I want my underwear or bedding clean and dry but there\\'s no programm for that. I want a convenient delay timer + programm design but app can\\'t do this. It only offers endless lists....10/26 It works again. Update of 10/12 will not load. App used to work now will not load. It\\'s pretty useless. Fix it and I\\'ll update my review, it used to work fine. Tried deleting and reinstalling, still will not work and webview is up to date..I like being able go get notifications when the washer has completed a cycle. But the notifications are too intrusive. The app should use standard notifications like every other app on my phone..The app wants nonsensical permissions, has varied from usable buggy to unusably buggy every two weeks for a year, and doesn\\'t seem to have a single compelling reason to use.  The LG WM9000HVA washer and DLEX9000V dryer are the best machines made but the smart side is just pointless AND frustrating..Downloaded app, turned on NFC, removed phone case and nothing. Can\\'t register appliance can\\'t use this app. I really hope this isn\\'t any indication of the performance of these brand new expensive washer & drier. ??.Other than smart diagnostic this app is absolutely useless. What\\'s the point of having the ability to set my oven from my phone but then have to walk over to it to use NFC. Not to mention the first time I did it it just defaulted to 350 degrees, not the 425 I asked for..Please delet this Application. Its Useless. 1. Cant detect whats the problem with the washer. ( diagnose problen washer) 2 . Theres No Dowload Wash For CLC ( TUB CLEAN) . 3.  LIMITED DOWLOAD WASHER.  4. Need To Have ( Wifi& Data Internet )  to Use this app..Only shows a spin and rinse cycle on my true steam washer/dryer... this feature was a big selling point for me... VERY disappointed..Why need SMS, Mic, Contacts? Uses NFC to devices doesn\\'t check NFC before LG account creation. Made account, only to find NFC not on phone, so APP won\\'t work..Doesn\\'t open.  I  tried earlier in the month, it didn\\'t work, so I uninstalled.  I waited 1-2 weeks, installed again and it is still not working  Update, uninstalled/reinstalled, still doesn\\'t work..App provides basic information that I was expecting once synced, but notifications are handled horribly.  No idea why standard notification bar is not used as all my other apps do, no LG insists on using a popup that interrupts any other app I am using my phone for.  Please fix this and I\\'ll revise my review..Works great on moto phone. App requires you not to be an idiot. Why people keep getting high end phones? Apps never run right on flagship phones and you pay more? Stupid..The app wants access to my pictures, calls, etc. Really? Ok, and after that it started asking my birthday... Do you really need all that information to connect to washing machine?.I gave it 4 only because of the inability to give you a detailed monthly review of the power consumption and door openings and that I always have to do audible diagnostic - the one through the wireless network does not work for me. Maybe it is a model restriction. Otherwise the app works perfectly!.Needed NFC to work, LG is running behind the market. This is a clear example of bad management, that provides requirements obsolete.Won\\'t connect to the appliance at all.  I was also confused why I had to sign up for a different account than when registering the products. I hope LG put more thought into building the appliance than this app/feature..This app does not work! I\\'ve connected my LG washing machine and dryer to my Wi-Fi several times and doesn\\'t fully register at all! This totally defeats the purpose of my LG dryer and washing machine supposedly being smart device!!!!!.App does what its supposed to do.   Easy to use. Plenty of 1 star reviews here unfortunately because these people don\\'t understand the technology or have been scare mongered into believing that everyone wants to access their private data through app permissions..This app is intrusive. Why does it need access to my contacts, access to my phone, access to my pictures, access to location and access to all my media. Explain why you need these features to simply use your app. This is not a safe app if it requires sensitive data..Just doesn\\'t work. Won\\'t even start up at all. Never experienced an app so poorly executed..Love my washer by Samsung but it sucks my Clothes smell I have cleaned sanitary it over overnight. Had two tech come out act like I was a stupid women.  So LG can you please help out a new growing family with appliances thank you from our family to your merry christmas.Why does an app that sends NFC commands to my washing machine need permissions to access my photos and make phone calls. Come on, be sensible!.Says execution failed. No...used to work now you failed. Love the idea of free help...but you did something and it sucks now.This new version is far more limited than the app that it replaces. I cannot see statistics (to see if cleaning is required) or start a clean tub cycle from the app anymore.  The instructions provided in the feedback by LG are inaccurate. In particular, the statement \"Second menu is Tub Clean\" is not correct. They should provide screen shots with their response. This just goes to further show that the support quality is as low as the quality of the app itself.  Update 12/23/2017: I downloaded the app again with the hope that maybe LG might have fixed the glaring problems with the app by now. They have not. Shame on them. This app that has a size of over 88MB and requires permission to make calls, access media files and locationof your phone on top of requiring user to log in to their online account still does absolutely nothing useful. LG has the most incompetent app developers in the world..App is not stable, it is worse than many beta apps. Also there is no possibility to set a time to switch on my aircon automatically, only with a primitive timer delay..Too many permissions needed. Why does it need access to access my pictures? If you deny any of the permissions the app won\\'t work at all!.Current version does not open, Pixel 2 XL Android 8. Poor QA and testing. Maybe you should publish APIs and allow others to develop apps that work or integrate with other systems like Google Assistant or similar..I cannot even open the app on my smartphone. My old smartphone will open it but it doesn\\'t have NFC so it\\'s not that helpful. Hope they come up with a fix quick as it\\'s very annoying that I paid so much for a nice washer and dryer and cannot use the Smart features.App works however it would be better if it told you the settings of the cycle. The only way to check is to download it and it may not be what you want so you have to download another one etc..Instructions are incorrect for my refrigerator and front-loading washer.  References buttons that don\\'t exist on my units.  Otherwise the app worked fine..Complete garbage. Forces close and on the rare instances that it doesn\\'t, it won\\'t pick up the nfc beam. The old app was so much better..This app does not give a place to input a problem. I am having a problem with the ice filling the glass and water filling the glass also have questions about some filter I can not purchase....i love my refrig please help.Doesn\\'t work with nougat phones. Webview has been integrated into Chrome and this app does not support it. I have even uninstalled Chrome to no avail.I have the nexus 5 with android 6.0.1, but the app doesn\\'t work.  LG could invest more in the app because I expected a good application for good products which are not cheap..This app doesn\\'t even launch! I\\'m running android 7.0 on a huawei honor 8. I followed your directions to uninstall and reinstall... Same result. This app doesn\\'t launch on my device..Crash on startup android 7, even after clear data and reinstall. Even when it used to work it was slow, clunky and limited features e.g. couldn\\'t set delay timer for oven. An embarrassment..Wow, my kids can write an app that runs for more screens before it freezes..The app stopped working on Samsung Galaxy S5. It does not even start..App doesn\\'t start. Galaxy s4 with lineageos 13. I found that it wont start if phone is rooted from blog.1.9.24 works on my zte axon 7 but doesn\\'t work on my oneplus one and nexus 5.Used to be a great product for controlling our air conditioning and now the app doesn\\'t even work rendering the additional Wi-Fi unit we purchased useless!.Crash immediately at lauch even after i reinstall several times. Seems like you dont want to fix it, so dissapointed.If the dryer turns itself off all the time the app is useless remotely, defeats purpose, if remote start turns itself off, also useless since I can\\'t tumble a load I left in the dryer for too long and want to get rid of wrinkles.App is rubbish can you guys fix it, You charge us heaps of money for your product but when things not working at least get buck to us and say we working on it. I think no LG again with this type of service..Doesn\\'t work and based on all the negative reviews it doesn\\'t seem like LG cares at all as they are doing nothing to fix..You can\\'t create you\\'re own cycles and you can\\'t view the pre made cycles in advance.  I downloaded the low temp cycle to my dryer and it is programmed to high temp with no chance to change it to ultra low. What\\'s the point of this app?.Failed execution try again? Why won\\'t the app even open?  Update 10/29/17 Randomly clicked on icon to try and open it while in the local mall and the darn thing opened and allowed me to create an account. Why in the hell won\\'t it work at my house?.LG SmartThinQ doesn\\'t work.  I\\'ve spend hours trying and retrying to connect my WT7200CW washer and DLG7201WE dryer, but I always get \"Product Registration Failure\". I get the same behavior with my iPhone too. :(.This app took up way too much memory and wanted access to everything on my phone. Why on earth do my washer and dryer need access to my pictures and contacts? I just wanted to upload pre-programmed wash cycles. This is not worth it..Utterly useless, my fridge-freezer has been making a loud noise for sometime and it\\'s diagnosis is, don\\'t open the door too many times, every single diagnosis is the same..Cannot figure out how to change the temperature and spin speed for preinstalled modes of my washer. Only default options are available and I cannot change it. Strange and inconvenient.I got my washer registered took a long time and then it doesn\\'t do what this app says it will doesn\\'t say how much longer my wash has left.Last time I buy from overly arrogant LG. After months of feedback, still has HUGE, RIDICULOUS permissions grab! Even signing in with other credentials is not enough for their marketing dept\\'s over inflated ego & sense of self importance! They insist on a birth date (yes, DATE, not just even year). And to demand my phone\\'s ID info - Why?! Other than they can! Then on to 3 separate fine print legalese Have-To-Read and approve documents. And FINALLY, after all that, it claims my info does not agree with their ToS! WtH?! Really?! It\\'s like my first HD LCD TV back in the day - called LG to find out how to get a software feature fixed, and service insisted \"We Never update our software\". Looks like LG has retained all the arrogance and marketing ignorance it ever had. Never again..App will not register new washer and dryer.  Try again LG you failed..Doesn\\'t need to know my location. Violation of privacy, doesn\\'t need access to my contacts and files such as photos. So they can sell my information to profit from it. Data thief\\'s..Update: Seems to be fixed. At least now the app runs on my phone. Remains to see if it actually does something!.App is clunky, doesn\\'t do very much, except interrupt what you\\'re doing with a most obnoxious popup instead of using a proper notification..I cannot believe that this app was created by one of the biggest electronic company in the world. So stupid app and cannot work with my LG washing machine..Progress bar gets to 25% then it says  \"Tag On process was interrupted or appliance was turned off.\" (It wasn\\'t.)  NFC and Android Beam are turned on. Did not remove phone from Tag On logo..I don\\'t want to give u so many permissions.I can\\'t even open it. It briefly flashes a window and then closes. I tried clearing data, reinstalling, and even another phone running lollipop instead of nougat. It just won\\'t launch..I tried to open the app, but it shows a black screen then it quits working. I need help. (Galaxy Note 2).Doesn\\'t work with my device. Nfc doesn\\'t even connect so I can\\'t use it. Will never purchase an LG washer or dryer again..Its a pain to use smart chip does nothing and bypasses router security through phone mac address security is bypassed.Does not work. Does not connect via Wi-Fi to my phone. Worked for the first 2 days I had it. Now, nothing.It dosen\\'t work. It will not turn on and I made sure my Android web view was up-to date. This is sad LG..Absolutely useless!! Won\\'t sync with my refrigerator on any of the devices new or old in my home! Pathetic! !!!.App does not open on samsung devices. Poorly designed app to be used with your white goods..Cannot go next NFC with brand new products. This app is worthless. Not worth the install..Useless, it pings to show that it has connected with the tag on but nothing happens on the app..Terrible. Large download. Requires you to register. Then downloads more. Doesn\\'t tag on. All of this to download a washing cycle to a washing machine..Fails to load on my recent model flagship phone even after reinstall..Has not worked in months on Samsung Note 8 running Android 7.1.  This definitely will make me think twice about buying LG again..Never connects to the product, the product is registered properly and it says the network it is connected to, but it never connects to the product..This app is garbage, just won\\'t work for my top load washer..I\\'m not quite sure why people are complaining about this app not working. It paired the first time I tried it with my washer and all of the features seem to work as advertised..Therible, pair almost inpossible. Uninstalled after one hour of horrible experience..Won\\'t connect to washing machine at all. Gets to 30% then says \"can\\'t connect\"... Useless.Congratulations! Working like a charm with my LG PM12SP 12000 BTU Ocean Smart Inverter. I can check the real time temperature of my house from anywhere, start the air condition and find my home warm when I arrive!!! Thank you LG..Will not open. As result cannot give anything but a 0..¬¬¬Ñ¬Ü ¬Þ¬à¬Ø¬ß¬à ¬Õ¬Ö¬Ý¬Ñ¬ä¬î ¬ä¬Ñ¬Ü¬à¬Ô¬à ¬å¬Ø¬Ñ¬ã¬ß¬à¬Ô¬à ¬Ü¬Ñ¬é¬Ö¬ã¬ä¬Ó¬Ñ ¬á¬à¬Õ¬Ö¬Ý¬Ú¬ñ? ¬£¬í ¬Ó ¬Ü¬Ñ¬Ü¬à¬Þ ¬Ó¬Ö¬Ü¬Ö ¬Ø¬Ú¬Ó¬×¬ä¬Ö, ¬Ù¬Ñ¬é¬Ö¬Þ ¬á¬Ö¬â¬Ö¬Ü¬Ñ¬é¬Ú¬Ó¬Ñ¬ä¬î ¬ã¬ä¬à¬Ý¬î¬Ü¬à ¬à¬Ò¬ì¬Ö¬Þ¬Ñ ¬ß¬Ñ ¬Ü¬Ý¬Ú¬Ö¬ß¬ä¬ã¬Ü¬à¬Ö ¬å¬ã¬ä¬â¬à¬Û¬ã¬ä¬Ó¬à? ¬ª ¬à¬ß¬à ¬á¬â¬Ú ¬ï¬ä¬à¬Þ ¬ß¬Ö ¬â¬Ñ¬Ò¬à¬ä¬Ñ¬Ö¬ä. ¬®¬â¬Ñ¬Ü..The worst app that I ever see in my life.Pur garbage. Cannot hookup with Galaxy 7Edge. Tried for 3 hrs..This app is working on android developer rom..  developer should use global rom.. this app working perfectly for me on mi max miui9 developer rom.. don\\'t know about global rom.Gives lots of random errors  it works sometimes..It does not work on Xiaomi Redmi Note 4.Push notifications don\\'t work on Oreo. Support never responded..Don\\'t work on OnePlus 5 with Android 7.The app is not working. It\\'s getting failed in execution..Should have zero stars. Won\\'t even open. Very disappointing..30% synced- FAIL. 65% sync- FAIL. 65% synced- FAIL. 78% syn- FAIL. 98% synced to the devic- FAIL.  Truly an 8/10 app, possible candidate for app of the year..Failed to tag on to the device in order to make use of the app..I have a lg phone and this app won\\'t run on it? How ironic....and it has the phone icon on the washer and dryer. Was this a plot to make me believe that I was getting my money\\'s worth???.FC. lg is making themselves look dumb again.Old app worked without a problem new app rubbish.Press WiFi icon tightly for more than 5 minutes, seriously? What does that even have to do with smart technology of the 21st century?.wasting my time. the login page is a joke.   dissapointed.Doesn\\'t work with huawei mate 9 (oreo).Just crashes. Won\\'t open at all on pixel XL..It crashed and does not work.Just downloaded and hoping I can use it with my washing machine. The app doesn\\'t even run. No error. It just won\\'t run. ??.Doesn\\'t really do anything for the washer and dryer... and I don\\'t see why it needs phone and camera permissions..Doesn\\'t seem to even work on a OnePlus One.Noticed an update and finally its working again! Took long enough jeeez!.Still doesn\\'t work. Can\\'t connect to server. Why?.Won\\'t run on most modern phones..\"Information you entered does not comply with our standards\"? I checked all the boxes. Not sure why I cannot register..Toally useless. Would not connect..App doesn\\'t work very poor!.Won\\'t work on one of the most popular phones in the world the Russian language at least starts. Guess they are more important.Not working... Very bad work for this big company....I can\\'t open this app after installing it. I tried uninstalling and reinstalled it and it still doesn\\'t open..Works well, but please let us have more than one phone be able to control the washing machine!.It doesn\\'t even launch, so I don\\'t know if it is a good app. (oneplus 3t).I can\\'t get it to work ??.This app does not support the washing machine, yet the washing machine has a Tag on function. There is no other app, ridiculous..Tag on washer dryer worked but smart diagnostic refrigerator audio was not understood by the app..This app is very slow ??.The screen goes black for a moment and the app closes without any error message.This app don\\'t open at all on my phone. Really very poor app. Hope you get this fixed ASAP..Doesn\\'t work. Waste of time..???? ????? ???? ????? ????? ?? ?? ???? ????? ???? ????? ??.Cant open the app in xiaomi note 4 Update can open but cant connect.October 26th \"upgrade\" destroyed wifi functionality with my LG refrigerator..Does not connect to my new robo vaccum cleaner. No nfc.No reason that this app needs to make and manage phone calls and access my media. None!.Still doesn\\'t work..doesnt even let you get passed the terms of aggreement page to sign up...what a waste.Keeps telling me my product is registered when it isnt the hole wifi is garbage i will be seeking a refund.Impossible to create an account!.why can\\'t I register my oled LG tv? give me this and I\\'ll give a better rating..Why does it need an account? To control MY dryer. Uninstall.\"the information that you entered does not agree with our terms of service\" - huh??.Why do I need to register and give all sorts of permissions just to use app?.App does not open. It says downloading products information..Why need email? Where are all the downloadable cycles listed in the manual?.Not opening on Redmi Note 3(Snapdragon 650).Not working in my redmi note 3.cant connect to my dishwasher nothing works.ÐÆÜâÙíÛöËÒòÁïÈàì÷Ü.The app does not even open.Does not even open with oneplus3.It simply doesn\\'t work!.Doesn\\'t connect to either washer or dryer.Not working on Xiaomi MI 5.Can\\'t launch on oneplus 3T oreo.Version 1.9.24 had run on my redmi 4x, good.¬±¬â¬Ú¬Ý¬à¬Ø¬Ö¬ß¬Ú¬Ö ¬Õ¬Ñ¬Ø¬Ö ¬ß¬Ö ¬Ù¬Ñ¬á¬å¬ã¬ä¬Ú¬Ý¬à¬ã¬î..Does not even open.  0 stars..Doesnt work.plase insert 30 min.Cannot open the app.Force closes/doesn\\'t load..Won\\'t even launch on Android Oreo....App doesn\\'t open.Simply doesn\\'t work with a phone of the same brand even..Doesn\\'t work.App won\\'t open.App doesn\\'t start.

Could your gays fix it ??????.Very goooood.Good.The old version worked. This one doesn\\'t. Besides, why do you need to control my calls, my camera and have my exact gps coordinates. Fix the app and remove the fine location requirement and you would have a good app. For now, i cannot fully utilize my LG appliance and i disapprove of that..CRASHES IMMEDIATELY. Completely unusable app. Don\\'t waste your time. It asks for a bunch of permissions that it shouldn\\'t need (Make phone calls, access all files and media etc.) then crashes. LG doesn\\'t respond to bad reviews or attempt to fix its problems. Uninstalled..I does not work, period.  Got new phone, now can NOT control my heat. What stupidity possessed you?  If it ain\\'t broke, don\\'t fix it.  Or change or update it!!!!!.Stopped working after the latest update. It only goes up to about 69% before it say \"Tag On failed. Try again. Make sure you are doing Tag On with a compatible LG product and then try again.\" It was working fine prior to the update..Latest update breaks the app. No longer will open, after working quite well for several months. Please fix this immediately..Requires too many permissions, and refuses to launch without. Uninstalled without trying any further..I purchased 2 washers and 2 dryers. app won\\'t recognize dryers and unable to connect. Can not find LG Smart Laundry&DW app. New dryer stopped heating. Reason we chose to upgrade to new units was the app and steam options. Which , both are useless.  Now unable to further troubleshoot dryer..Apparently the view last cycles feature is no longer available. So there isn\\'t much point to this app now unless you want to download a cycle (which you can just manually set on the washer and program to custom).Useless app, does not open at all. Crashed as soon as it opens. Considering the amount of money spent on my washer dryer and the promotions really disappointing and looking at the comments seems LG is doing nothing to fix the issue.First time this app actually worked for me but only on my S5 not my S7. But out works on the S5. Kinda cool when out works there are 20 or so additional settings for both washer and dryer..The app quit working, I uninstalled it, reinstalled it and still does not open. Another brilliant LG product..App works as advertised. Great to know when the washer is done so you can get the clothes in the dryer promptly and start another load if need be while you do other things..Aplikacja koszmar. T©©umaczenie maszynowe, po©©owa funkcji kompletnie nie dzia©©a, ociezala masakra jaka?. Przez to t©©umaczenie nie da si? z tego korzysta?.    aktualizacja: Po ostatnich aktualizacjach aplikacja przesta©©a dzia©©a? ca©©kowicie - nie da si? wgra? ?adnego nowego programu do pralki. A poniewa? nie ma ona wbudowanego programu p©©ukania to nie mog? w©©?czy? samego p©©ukania w og?le.. Wi?c teraz nie tylko aplikacja ale ca©©a pralka jest wybrakowana, ?wietnie...Really, I have to download on my work iPhone to use this app - very embarrassing.Same opinion as every one below. But the only one LG responded to was the comment in Russian. Why? And remove the app from the Market until it\\'s fixed..It doesnt diagnostic anyrhing. I have a problem which I think it is the control board but it didnt find anyproblem..I tried installing this on a nexus 6 with android 7.1. The app doesn\\'t start at all, no message, nothing.Won\\'t even Open and Run. Like other reviews, waste if time. Don\\'t bother..After update the app it doesn\\'t work. App didn\\'t able to open.Used to work, then update made it where app wouldn\\'t open. Recently had to reset my phone and now app installed but won\\'t let me open.One BIG minus for the washer and app. It does not have \"only spin\" function and I can\\'t sdd it through app. For me it is the basic one. Model F0J6WY1W..Why do you need access to my phone, contacts, etc? Why, despite registering an account on this app I can\\'t log on website?.Bad app....can\\'t run on my Asus Z601KL.A total waste of time and money!.Suddenly this app cannot be run in my Xiaomi Mi5s/Android 6.01 and Xiaomi Mi6/Android 7. When I start the app it automatically closed..Never got to use it because it force closes.! Looks like it has been going on for a while..My robot hoover lg was not even listed as device.I installd but not opening.LG app doesn\\'t open on LG smartphone. Are you serious?.I downloaded app but it is not going to open..No 1 worst app, it\\'s not even open. 88MB ????. Don\\'t try this App.cant even open app.App does not open on galaxy s8. Gets forced closed immediately.Does not open/load at all..Cannot start the app.It\\'s force closing..App don\\'t open.Don\\'t work.App not working.It doesn\\'t open.... Eat a dick..App not opening crashes immediately.Crashes immediately.Samsung\\'s.Super.Force closes immediately..Doesn\\'t even start..WORST.....I have Notice all of the negative comments that all of us has put on here lg this is insane that we should have problems like this. We have spent our hard earned money for your products and this is the type of service that we get. I have purchased your sidekick washer and dryer and can\\'t even get it to connect to the network. This has to stop can this issue please get corrected as soon as possible..from what i noticed the apps does not support with android nougat onwards because this app need to use webview to open it and android nougat onwards does not use webview at all..please update your software because a lot of LG user will be so disappointed. the idea is great but the software developer sucks...New app will not allow schedule setting for air conditioner. Had to Uninstall and find old version of old app to gain functionality back   Updated version of app will not allow me to set a off only reservation time. I like to turn on the ac when I like, but make sure it shuts off when I leave. It forces me to make a turn on time.As others have noted, the app has been crashing immediately upon opening since the latest update. LG, please investigate and rectify as soon as possible. With a broken app, I now have a washer and dryer that have one less feature..Can someone tell me exactly what I am supposed to be able to do with this app because it\\'s not working.  I was able to connect my washer but when I tap in the washer it tells me my washer has to be connected to Wi-Fi then it closes. Ummm is that even possible?  Also, what does this do again?.This crock of junk just wasted 30 minutes of my life. 20 minutes registering, providing my birthday and other spurious phone permissions, 5 minutes of opening it and enduring it crash and 5 minutes convincing it to uninstall. Save yourself the time and agro - avoid. I downloaded this app because my lg fridge just conked out after 7 months. Probably built by the same team that developed this app. Naught stars..It worked perfectly with my washing machine.. then... A new update came... I can\\'t launch the app. It opens and closes immediately on my  Xiaomi mi 5. I tried to reinstall it and it does the same thing... 1star.. it\\'s useless now the app.Absolutely terrible.  I literally still have to physically load my clothes into the washer before I use the app. I thought the point of the app was to make life easier, instead I have to get up, separate my lights from the colors and load soap too. I might as well just push a button while I\\'m there to turn it on.  Wish I could give 0 stars!.Permissions are unacceptable.  You don\\'t need location services to connect to wifi.  You should use my built-in dialer like everyone else, not implement your own to demand phone rights.  No explanation for contacts, camera, microphone, and SMS.  It used to work without all of that.  Isn\\'t making me sign up for your service enough?.It was working well on Note 5. Changed to Note 8 and stopped working. Dishwasher connected to the network but it cant be seen on app. Can\\'t see any information,I can receive alerts only..My new dryer connected immediately without an issue. The washer that I bought at the same time and sits right next to it, cannot complete the connection process. It says fails to register and what it really means is that it cannot connect to the WiFi. Though neither I, nor LG support could figure out why. Especially since the dryer sitting next to it didn\\'t have a problem. I had BestBuy replace it and the replacement has the exact same problem. Yay for BestBuy. Boo for LG..Horrible. Would connect to fridge and show in my devices but then the app would say the fridge was not turned on and it would not connect. Tried ten times and them dropped the device and registered it again and still would not connect..Used to work till update, now useless. Can\\'t connect to WiFi then closes itself. Old app worked great, please fix so I can download settings again..There is nothing SMART about an app that dont work. Pretty sure my internet and wifi all work. YUP, sure does. WORTHLESS APP!!.The app is not lunching. My question to LG is why the issue is not resolved  after lots of complaints. I assume you people are not serious about customer\\'s issue. This kind of attitude is not acceptable..Can\\'t open the App. Once opening the App closes immediately. Tried with Android 4 and 6. Terrible..App doesnt work. Opens, says can\\'t connect and crashes. Waste of time..It worked, then a nice little update broke it. It says that it can not connect to the internet. The same internet that this phone is connected to and posting this review. LG please fix this..According to my firewall, I see that you have already downloaded all of my sensitive information. But when i want to check my washing machine to see how many cycles are left before it needs to be cleaned, your app says \"Error SmartThinQ App. Failed execution. Try again.\" How about you take your cr4p app and YOU try again!!! Less is more. Go back to one app per type of device, no one is going to go all in LG given your app failures..Same problem as everyone else. App says it\\'s not connected to the internet but phone clearly is..Waisted an hour trying to get my lg oven and dishwasher to work with this app....then today had the thought of checking the reviews here....sure enough I\\'m not alone. Lg makes big money selling appliances with fancy NFC control.....they owe us refunds.....or need to fix their app.Washing machine fault and the old LG Smart Laundry forces me to install this rubbish, register a new account (when I have emails to prove I have registered before) and then it doesn\\'t bleeping work! No idea what the fault is and who to call now....... daft!!!!.Totally worthless.  Was told it would diagnose my problem.  The appliance made some cool beeps and tones.  The app, however, would not respond..Doesn\\'t work. Went through the registration, but now it tells me it won\\'t connect and shuts down..Works prefect after downgrading to version 1.8.x  I bought a home bot vacuum and installed the 1.9 app which was useless. No connection to network and constant crashes. I tried in different phones and same issue. LG customer support had no solution. I was told te restart my phone reinstall (did it like 20 times).   Then I read that older app version worked fine, gave it a try and magic! It works as advertised! Love it!  I don\\'t why LG does not correct this issue. There are thousands ppl with same problem and being ignored.... they are losing tons of revenue....Ever since the update my washer wwand dryer say there off  or not connected.The application was working fine in the beginning.... Now it\\'s stopped working after last update... Don\\'t know why?.Totally useless same problems as everyone else says cannot connect to network then closes the app. Why even keep this on the play store if you aren\\'t going to bother trying to make it work.Network error - Can\\'t connect to SmartThinQ\\'s network.  Cannot get this app to work.  Terrible implementation and support..You have to disable you\\'re mobile network and activate WiFi and then the app works fine, just a slight nuisance..Says network error when I try to use with washer and dryer. I will probably return my washer and dryer well I still can just because I was lied too about  what it could do..App is not supporting latest models. Crashes. My washer+dryer is a combo which is not even possible to register. It says it can not connect to the network. But Iam getting notifications when washing is done!!!????? LG... Amateur hour.....After most recent update, app crashes on start up..Never connects to the washer. As soon as I click on the washer, an error message \"network failure\" comes up and the app force closes..just meeps saying to check my internet connection bring back the old app or fix this one.Crashes when trying to open an appliance \"cannot connect to SmartTinQ network\".App crashes after recent update.. please fix it..Not working on my samsung note 3, android lolipop root.Absolute junk. Crashes on \"can\\'t reach network\", even the phone is online with no issue..keeps telling me I have poor internet connection & then closes out. what a waste..Bought washer and dryer for this...doesn\\'t even work.Currently unusable, be warned if you are buying an appliance that uses this app.Tells me to connect to Wi-Fi which is working fine then closes the App. Please fix..Only tells you there is a network error. Its completely useless.This app is junk! All it does is crash..\"Can\\'t connect to SmartThinQ network\" then crashes. Do they even have a QA department?.This app is riddled with problems. Downloaded it on three different devices all devices experienced their own unique bugs within the app..After updating I can\\'t connect to air conditioner.App says my washer and dryer is not on or not on the network but I also downloaded the app on my work iPhone which has no problem connecting to the appliances..Not working with android system 7.1.1. I have tried everything. Someone from LG support says that I should try it on another phone. Well I don\\'t have any other phone!.Worst app its not getting open only.FC, absolutely ridiculous! Waiting for an update..Not so \"Smart\". Does not work..Doesn\\'t work, just crashes.Will not open, spend hundreds on a machine for the 21st century, get a donkey for an app..Shame  on LG ...it sucks it\\'s WORTHLESS.Doesn\\'t work. Waste of time..Its not working.. Just crashed.What\\'s the point in having this app cause my washer and dryer have tag on and I can\\'t even select a mode for my dog stuff.App doesn\\'t start properly.The app keeps crashing..App does not open at all..forced close after update.Nice app! Working nice on my LG G6. #TeamLG ??? THANK YOU LG INOVATION!.App crashes every time.This doesnt work.This app is not at all working. Zero rating for this app..Cannot connect to LG network.Can\\'t even get in the the app!!! This sucks!.Not working!.Does nothing..Not opening at all.Not opening at all.Works great!  Easier than programming the range settings on range control panel..Doesn\\'t open.Not working....Dont  work.Not working.Crashing on startup.Very bad.Worst app.Crashes on startup.very good.The app notification with remote control feature is useful. When washing machine done its task, or something went wrong, it alerts me with popup message on this phone. Refrigerator is also controllable, hopefully the energy saving feature would work actively sooner. Air conditioning works as I expected. The launching speed of this app has improved. I think the app is getting better..The app worked well at the first time then the AC lost connection to WiFi and said it is either turned off or not connected to WiFi ?? Things got worse with this update as the product fails to connect to the network. Come on LG.Doesn\\'t work after a day of using it. I can\\'t get it to open at all. Have tried reinstalling several times.Cant open the app. App crash. After uninstall the app and reinstall. Still the same. Country Singapore.Worthless app. Doesnt do anything, all i can do is upload a cycle to my washing machine. That is completely useless..Followed the steps on connecting window air conditioner multiple times  but wouldn\\'t work. Really no point to this app if you can\\'t connect appliances.DOESN\\'T WORK  ANYMORE. Pls. change your programing team..I have to take my phone case off to use it on my washer dryer. Yet i dont with paying at store or wireless charging. Its just the smallest otterbox..Dosnt open!!! Tried many times, even reinstalled the app but cant open the app...The app does not connect to my inverterV the older version did though.Excellent.  Just follow intructions and check your unit has wifi capability..Not working! The app wont event start! Dont advertise something in your products if it doesnt work!.App wouldn\\'t even open. I uninstalled and reinstalled twice..After the latest update the app won\\'t even launch..It does not work.Jusr downloaded and the app just cant be open.Application isn\\'t starting on a Sony Xperia Z5.Just installed and it won\\'t open up.App doesn\\'t even open.. frustrating...? app ??????.Not opening........ Very angry????.Doesn\\'t even run.It won\\'t launch.Not working on xiaomi.Can\\'t connect..good.I deeply regret I bought an LG washing machine. The app does not even start \\nwithout permissions to read my location, make and manage phone calls, and \\naccess my photos. I guess it is time to file a GDPR complaint to either \\nforce LG to comply with the rules or to get their products banned in the \\nEU. My mobile phone operator and my location are none of your business, LG. \\nAnd no, you don\\'t need to check for available space before downloading a \\nfile. You can instead report an error if the download fails..Why I need to allow to use my phone, contacts, location  to this app to manage my washer machine? I choose deny and the app simple doesn\\'t run.  Even if you are committed to inform about terms and conditions is abusive the way that you request private information to use an app that is not even compatible for devices without wifi.  My washer has tag on and not wifi. I couldn\\'t find any app fom lg to support my device.It is a first timer that a new app si worst than the old one.  I own a washing machine that is compatible.  Could not download new cycles.  Could not find all the cycles that the old app had.  Could not start the tub cleaning from the app.  I could only find a how to guide but no start cleaning button as in the old app.  Etc, etc, etc.  It is full of bugs and takes forever to load.   The phone is One Plus 3 with the latest android 7.0.2 updates. Thank you.   PS: Let us use the old app.  Later edit 29 august 2017: Tried again to work with the app on a new phone OnePlus 5... Nothing new, nothing works. Support is awful. Wish that Google will ban apps with this much negative reviews. Never going to buy LG again..Very flawed. I managed to connect my appliance to the app by using a second device as a mobile hotspot then during registration it let me select my preferred wifi..Seemed to be ok but would not finish registration, so not working. Retried several times, no change. Could not find a contact site for help either, so no good unless help is available. Unit is heat pump, AC mini split.Rubbish. took me 12 minutes to load up on my Samsung. And iPhone not much better. Before update it wasn\\'t too bad but since update forget it. Waste of $60 for ac wifi adaptor. Bought a wifi remote works great. Hell of a lot quicker too..Can\\'t get registration completed total waste of time. I\\'ve a good mind to take LG to court because the sales person promoted being able to use this feature and was a primary reason I purchased LG. Very disappointed.I cannot get my WT7200C washing machine to connect to Wi-Fi either the app is broken or washing machine is broken (brand new out of the box 8/26/2017) I held the Wi-Fi button per app direction and wifi light does not turn on..App doesn\\'t even start on android 6 device. Don\\'t waste your time. @support. Just a blank screen..App works great. Don t know why it has such bad reviews. Downloads all my custom wash cycles without an issue. Thank you LG.It\\'s a good thing I didn\\'t buy the washer and dryer for this perk. I\\'m supposed to have my dryer close to the router with no obstacles? Not gonna happen. Check frequency on router and change if necessary? No. Washer and dryer are great so far. The app? Uh-nah..Just bought a new washer (WM5000HWV) and dryer (DLEX5000) .  Should be a no brainer to connect them with this app..right? NOPE can\\'t connect to either one.  Can not get any of the special features noted by the * to activate  including WIFI.  Can\\'t find any documentation to help me figure out what to do. Spent a LOT of money for these fancy appliances, 1st time I\\'ve ever bought new ones, so disappointed!.Figured it out with my washing machine, but the instructions are unclear and vague. I searched online for answers and found nothing until I read the LG support replies to the negative reviews. Here is what I did:  1. Make sure NFC, WiFi, and Bluetooth are all enabled on your phone and your phone is close to the power button of the washing machine.   2. Start the phone app first and have it ready at the waiting to connect screen.   3. Turn on the washing machine and immediately hold the \"*Wi-Fi\" button for 3 seconds (the WiFi button doesn\\'t work if the machine has been on for a while)   4. The knob of the washing machine should have the checkered glow pattern during this entire process and the red WiFi light symbol should turn on after you held the button.  5. The phone should still be close to the power button of the washer and the phone app should detect the machine pretty quickly. (If it still can\\'t detect it, try using a different phone. My phone detected it but my wife\\'s phone didn\\'t, different Samsung phones)   6. The phone app will then ask you to give your Wi-Fi login information to the Washing machine. Once that is entered, the product will be registered and you can begin  tinkering with the gimmicky features and diagnostic tools.   It\\'s a shame the phone app didn\\'t provide clear instructions. I wasted a lot of time figuring this out, which is why I am leaving a low review score..Doesn\\'t work at all. Maybe you should have worked out the bugs before you launched it or used it as a marketing tool..NFC tags don\\'t work and there\\'s no way to manually ad. No way to have notifications sent to phone: don\\'t understand what the point of the app is.Convenient app to control split system aircon but is WAY too slow to open the app (on wifi and 4G)  Please update app to make it a fast booting app so I can turn my AC off without having to wait ages :(.Need to add description of what each wash cycle does so users can decided what ones to use..App doesn\\'t do anything useful. It\\'s garbage and so is my new dryer. You suck LG..can\\'t connect my washer. loops in connecting to device. Manage to connect but run into another problem: I need to know the allowed chars in the wifi password pls.Don\\'t see why I need to grant access to my location or my contacts to use the app? Not going to use it based on the fact that it won\\'t allow me to unless I grant it these permissions.Terrible app, Samsung s8 plus and it doesn\\'t load.   Have the extra cycle on my washing machine which I can\\'t use, my old LG machine had a quick wash for 2kg loads. Frustrating.Slow to download, install and open, and then doesn\\'t work on any of my devices. Waste of time..Why the hell does this app need access and permissions to make and manage phone calls, access to photos and contacts, and location to turn on an AC? Don\\'t bother with this one folks..I am trying to connect my LG fridge to the app. But numerous attempts just results in Product Registration Failure. Need some help on this.I don\\'t like the way the app functionality is limited I feel like before the update the app was amazing amazing and would have given it five stars but given it to now.Just bought my new washing-dryer machine f4j8jh2w and i can not register it in the app!! What am i doing wrong?can anyone help me?.,its a app for a washer and dryer...why are you making it so difficult?Difficult pairing, alerts out of control, and now the registration NAG. Keep it simple.Why does an app to manage my kitchen appliance need to access as much as this does on my phone? Access denied and removing..The app never worked! It crashes immediately after I start it. (rooted phone).Cannot connect to my washer or dryer. Just keeps looping through failed try again..Stopped working with latest release  Get \"unknown error code during applicaiton run: -1000.It stopped working. Says \"failed to start, trt again\" and it not the webview issue..I cant open the app. It gives an error code -1000. I cant belevie this \"app\" exists!.Didn\\'t work at all, and I tried the set up 3 times.  Uninstalling..I can\\'t think of a reason for LG to know my device\\'s location.Dosen\\'t work on oneplus 5, webview is not relevant on android n!.doesn\\'t work with my new laundry washer and dryer..The app doesn\\'t work.  Not even a little bit..Its not even opening. You are too big company to make app like this. Smart LG? I dont think so!.Not had a problem so far using for my Aircon only thing I need help with is the filter management what filter is it referring to and where is it.Can\\'t start the app at all: unknown error code during application run: -1000..Only way I can access the app is by searching for it in the play store or looking for it under installed apps.  Would be nice to have an icon or widget I can access..Its cool to be able to download programs to washer and dryer but also diagnostics future is quite works well!.App crashes too often..Can\\'t  get the washer and dryer to connect to my WiFi.. main reason I bought it.Won\\'t connect to the network! No idea why, have done everything! Should not be this hard..The app requires too many permissions.This app has been fixed works perfect on Android and iOS great job!!!.Wants way too much permission as defaults for what it needs to really do.App doesn\\'t start at all!  Did you test before releasing?.Cannot select a normal wash and choose temp..Did not work... At all ....Bogus useless.VERY VERY SLOW.Very helpful.Very helpful.Cannot get my WT7200CW to connect to wifi since the 7/17 update to the app. Have emailed and done the chat to no avail. Said they would get back to us but haven\\'t heard back. So frustrated as the wifi was one of the main reasons I purchased this washer and dryer. Their customer service is terrible. I strongly recommend against buying their products..The app states that you don\\'t need to create a new LG account but apparently it does not have my account details. Login fail. Email address no records found thus password reset fail as well. Horrible app. And probably you should clarify on the permission given to the app? I\\'m gonna delete this right away..This app is terrible. I\\'ll never buy an LG appliance again. I\\'m trying to use this app to remotely monitor my LG fridge at a second home. Earlier versions of this app were hit and miss, but at least I could monitor the fridge operation. But now, it\\'s almost completely useless because if electrical power at the residence fails then comes on again, I physically have to be at the location to reconnect the fridge to the wifi!  It should reconnect automatically! POS  app which makes the appliance a POS too..Bought the F14WM8KN1 washing mashine... And this stupid app just doesnt connect with it... Mashine has nfc, but no option to connect with nfc... Return the smart laundry app!!! Or add a function to add devices by serial number or smth like that!! Start hating LG already! Cuz also no response fro support since last week! Shame on you!.Very disappointed! This app is useless. It cant connect to the server. And also, app is asking permissions for phone logs, access to images and files and also asking for location? Seriously LG -__-  I prefer the previous app for the laundry which cant be used anymore now ¤Ì¤Ì.Have tried a dozen times to connect our fridge to our wifi. Every time it says it\\'s registered and working. Then the fridge says product registration failure. And it wants me to try again. Reading online this appears to be a common issue. Completely worthless. Don\\'t waste your time worth this a or buy LG for their wifi option..Worked fine for me. I did have to play around with getting the phone and machines to make a good connection for the link (moving the phone to just the right spot). Took maybe 10 minutes. I just wish there was a towel mode (my set doesn\\'t have that setting) but I\\'m happy with the denim one..Explain why you recently added the mandatory location permission requirement.  There is absolutely no reason for you to require my location.  It work previously without the location permission.  Your reason of why you need the permission doesn\\'t make any sense exspecially since it was working previously without that permission, and again, there is no logical reason as to why you require the location permission except to be able to identify your customers which is a privacy issue.  Absolute junk until this requirement is removed..Permissions? You have to know my location!? Why?   Difficult to connect to their newest fridge.  Doesn\\'t diagnose why my ice maker isn\\'t working and says everything is ok.   Constantly gives me errors about it being connected..Never connects and always needs to download new information which takes a really long time. Wish my washing machine just had all the extra functions on it instead of needing to use this silly app.Bloated and slow. Always has to download product information and takes way too long to get into the app. I just want to turn the air con on not stare at a spinning circle..I cannot set up Custom Cycles for my washer or dryer. The different settings and Cycles do not match my washer and dryer. The app has no idea what kind of washer and dryer I have. Very disappointed..I can\\'t get the log in screen to come up. I just installed the new version and click on log in then a blank screen comes up. Nothing..Why does it need to \"make and manage phone calls\"? That is not reasonable for a fridge app. Never got it working..About as useful as a chocolate teapot. Can\\'t even switch my LG washing machine on and off remotely, but a manager somewhere can boast their product has an app..Wants access to location, phone state and logs, and device storage. App refuses to run if access to all this isn\\'t granted. No way, LG, not doing it..I assumed this would let me send in the temperature to the oven etc. but you always have to touch your phone to the oven spot. Not sure what the point is then?? Might as well just push the buttons, it takes way less time than trying to hold your phone in the tight spot. This would be a good idea if you could send it from anywhere in your house but it\\'s useless to me now unfortunately. Deleting it...Slow to connect.  Give the ability to actually control the machine by selecting temperature and spin speed.  Essentially the older machines with a custom button is better than this so called feature.  Its worthless..This app would not even open on my Samsung Note 4 phone.  Message was failed execution. No excuse for a company that manufactures android phones!   It is worse to have a function that fails than not to have a function that doesn\\'t work..I went to register my washing machine it didn\\'t even let me specify the type of washer by serial number or model number and it\\'s telling me to hold down the wifi button on my machine and there isn\\'t one. I\\'m so frustrated.Need to download download cycle to my F14A8YD2 That app i gone, washer brand new  where is lg smart laundry &dw  I think this app is replacement but i does not have that feature for mine maskine  That\\'s not costumer frindly to trash apps to replace them with others that dont have the funcanality you have bought a machine with.All I want is a short wash with a high spin. Not much to ask. Not 3 hour washes. I thought this app would help, but it gives no details of cycle length or spin speed. Y\\'know, the things people in real houses with mountains of washing would really like to know.....Not possible to register an expensive LG air conditioner. Waste of time!.This app is terrible. It will not connect to either my new washer or dryer. Searched all over and still can\\'t find any support docs to help troubleshoot. Waste..Terrible app! It somehow manages to make my AC unit, which typically works great, not work at all..Unfortunately I have to agree with the majority of reviews. I can easily log on to my LG account via my PC, but this app keeps telling me my email or password is wrong. Tried it 5 times, it IS NOT wrong - the app is defective..Pass. You\\'re gonna spend WAY more time trying (and failing) to get this app to do something useful (hint: it doesn\\'t) than it will ever save you..I see no point to this app. What happened to the smart laundry & dw app, where I could at least check my washer stats? This doesn\\'t seem to serve any purpose..Garbage app. Requests unnecessary permissions, crashes at startup on one phone and fails device self test on another..Deleted after 5min of usage. Unless you have a WiFi enabled appliance, you have to tap the phone to the appliance to get it to send a command. If I\\'m already in front of the oven, why not just push the buttons on the actual oven?.It worked okay at first. Now I get a fail to execute message when I open the app. Some of the functions on the app for the a/c dont have a help tip or other menu to explain functions. I have to grab the manual to see what they do..Absolutely rubbish. Doesn\\'t work at all on a Samsung S7.  Secondly why do you need permission to all my files???? LG washing machines are horrible. Stick with Samsung or Bosch.TERRIBLE user interface design and function with washing machine.  Very inconvenient to use..For anyone facing the connection timeout problem i suggest you use another device (smartphone or tablet) as a hotspot and connect your a/c (or other smart LG appliance) to that hotspot so that the product can be registered. Then you change the network to your normal wifi connection. That\\'s how i got it to work :).One of the worst app. Why need to connect to the net everytime i need to use the app? I don\\'t thh\\'nk it\\'s necessary to connect online once the appliance is set up. Also, i thought the diagnostics can be done without the help of the cs. The advertisement sends a wrong message. Very disappointed..I just want to be able to set my own settings on my washer & dryer and not be constrained by the limits imposed by the built-in cycles. Specifically I want to dry my towels on high heat but all this app does is provide more predefined cycles..Update must have helped I was able to connect my two new washer and dryer in under 5 min. Can monitor time left and remote start. I have the dryer dlex9500k and washer wm9500hka they all have smartthinq logos on the front of them..Won\\'t even work on my LG G3 phone...unknown error...what a piece of junk.....Where do I begin? Super massive size for no reason, constantly had to download things, requires permissions that it doesn\\'t need. Oh and the functionality is very limited.Why do you want my photo and contacts just scan the bloody machine.This app doesn\\'t work. I cannot register my LG Air Conditioner..Essentially a spy App. It wants permissionto control andodify data on your phone with the promise of a very limited usability. Be careful, don\\'t install.Force you to grant permissions, works extremely slow, requires registration.App is garbage.just like lg products, never buying anything lg again.Only occasionally works, and functions are almost useless in any case.Why this app don\\'t have information about each waching cycle. We need brief details about time it takes, temperature, spin etc  Now we have to install each cycle to see the details..wifi not work, reg. failed, shame!.only wifi nfc useless :(.Updated app on 07/19/2017 and now able to successfully register my refrigerator. Able to control temperature. Have not used the other features yet.Slow to load app and register product hard to connect and does not offer 5Ghz connection to modern WiFi..Works fine with my new washing machine using NFC to communicate. I can add new wash programs and check when a cleaning cycle is required. Well done LG ??.Can you please do option of the spin cycle only. Works great but lacking spin only option.i am not used this app.I just registered the app and finally found a diagnosis for my fridge ..When i install application won\\'t open it says unknown error code during application run: -1000.Requiring an sd card which my phone does not have.????? ????? ?? ?? ?????? ????? ????. ?????.didn\\'t work!.C\\'mon, can\\'t reach the product registration.Doesn\\'t work!!.Does not work.The app don\\'t open.Doesn\\'t work!  Neither does my new oven!  Great job!.Collects & sell to 3rd party? ??.1 hour to complete.Not reliable.Great app.Only one wash or dry cycle available to download for our new set. No custom options. I was hoping we could set up our own settings and make it available to use. This app was no help with the washer, luckily it looks like the settings we wanted for the dryer is the one that was available.   Received a response to my review above that doesn\\'t help at all, even says to press an equals button which there is none in the app. This app has no options for creating your own cycle which is what I wanted it for. We are having problems with the washer not cleaning the clothes since it has almost no water in the washer. We can babysit each load and keep telling the washer to add water until it actually cleans the clothes. We hoped we could get just the simple washer options of water level, and temperature. From the app..I have a 3 year old LG 14000 BTU A.C. unit that the smart A.C. app. Worked great on,  now I\\'m forced to use this inferior app. Which only allows me to access like 3 out of 7 modes my A.C. is capable of running and 90% the time after the after I turn the machine on and it\\'s running the app. Sais that control failed or something and closes.  Give me back the smart A.C. app why do I have to use this app..Update 25 June. This app just keeps getting worse. Will not connect via Wi-Fi any more. Even with full reset. App also requires too many permissions. Cmon LG get your act together.It was great at first then the ac\\'s wifi light turned off and when I tried to reconnect it deleted my registered product. Now I can\\'t get the app to register my ac or the app to work at all. I have reset, uninstalled and reinstalled, rebooted and cleared cache... nothing works. And now the wifi light continues to blink. This is frustrating..Utter garbage. Doesn\\'t work for my washer (model DLEX5101V) even though there is the smart diagnostic sign next to the power button. Very disappointed when technology is advertised but workmanship and quality are the pits. This is a bait and switch..Why does this app need permissions to my camera, phone calls, and ability to access my SD card?  App will not let me in without authorizing access. I think I\\'ll just do my laundry the good ole fashion way-press the button myself..Works a treat. I don\\'t know what all the one stars are about. I have a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. It works with my LG FH4A8FDH2N.  If you believed the rivalry hype between the two companies in South Korea, online.  My two items shouldn\\'t be compatible!  I love my LG and Samsung products equally.  If you are going to make this Englishman choose between one or the other, it will be neither.  I believe in being who you are and not what the media brainwashes and conditions with their propaganda.  I don\\'t have a television or radio, I don\\'t want either, I am happy to find out for myself, what the next person is like without prejudice..Have portable AC  When registering it connects to the AC and my home network, AC beeps then see the loading on my phone - says registered successful.  Then goes back to screen and says it is \"connecting\" but eventually then comes back and now says \"registration failure\"  Have latest download, tried with cellular both on and off (Samsung s7).  Looks like the AC is just not connecting directly to home network.  Signal is strong and no router issue.  Just will not connect.  Feature was the only reason I spent the extra money for this LG AC, otherwise would have bought something else!.***Edited to add that with the update released on 16/06/2017 it seems to have fixed the issues I was having with registering my air conditioner.***  Bring back the old app. At least it worked. Ever since this new app was released I have had constant problems. And I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app. It won\\'t even let me register my air conditioner in the app. It gets to step 3 and just sits there until it times out. One of the reasons I bought this air conditioner (less than 12 months ago) was for the wifi capability. This is NOT fit and proper for the purpose it was marketed for if I can\\'t get the wifi to work. Many people have complained of issues with this app yet it doesn\\'t seem to get any better..Had an update yesterday to this app.  Tried it again with my LTE turned off on my phone and just the wifi on and it worked!  Connected right up..Totally useless app. Doesn\\'t even open. Can\\'t diagnose my LG Refrigerator now and customer care is also not replying. Very poor service LG and a lot poorer app. Dissappointed!.Why does this new app not work !!! The old AC app worked fine. After install it just sits there after trying to login. EDIT... Yes i did see if webview needed an update. Which it didnt. After uninstalling and reinstalling about 4 times.. then after waiting about 30 min sitting there trying it finally logged in. I am sorry its still not a great app..Problem was due the wireless mode not able to support Wireless N.     Having issues connecting to my Hom bot, registration stated successful but upon connection to device \"Product registration failure\". Tried registering again but still same issue..Won\\'t connect. Wifi never starts blinking. Got email suggest to push wifi button immediately after power on. Still doesn\\'t work. Suggested I change the review after trying to connect as suggested. Would change rating but there is no zero!!!!.Doesn\\'t do any diagnosis at all!! Tried to do a smart diagnosis of my washing machine six times. The app failed to do any diagnosis every time..Pretty cool, uses old dial up like scratchy sound from dishwasher to tell app possible errors.  I need repairs still. But the app can\\'t tell me the model number. Is that smart? I don\\'t think so..wants to know you whole life. whole phone realy everything. then facebook....then it doesn\\'t work on a brand new lg washer 6-2017. I won\\'t swear here, but I would like to..Why do big company\\'s in there over staffed offices with technicians to change a rheam of paper...change things that work perfectly  before... All the money you make you can\\'t make the a simple app  to support what we purchase from you... Poor poor..  Yes you will reply  As follows..  Dear Scott.... Sorry to here of your inconvenience  bla bla garbage... Have a board meeting and do something  after 10 people in boardroom vote... Poor as... I have 1 phone and  a 4g tablet that no longer works.... Joke....Why can I only pick certain cycles with this app? What if I just want a normal cycle? Also why can\\'t I see the time of the cycle on the app? This isn\\'t that hard of an app to build. Need to see changes..Old app worked. New one just gives error after error. Disgraceful forcing users to move to a faulty app. Already sent an email to LG. The pointless contact us at ...is an automated an apparently unmonitored email..Is not compatible with my washer/dryer and will not let me run the old app. Complete waste of space. Do not install - do not buy an LG machine.It doesn\\'t work with the product, why pay extra for wifi enabled? At least the ac unit works. Thanks LG.AJUTOR! Deci am un frigider LG cu exact panoul de control pe care ?l arat? ?n aplica?ie dar nu am g?sit nicio sigl? . (?n manualul frigiderului spunea  c? poate fii monitorizat cu o aplica?ie dar nu ?tiu care. Am g?sit aceasta care p?rea chiar compatibila cu ce spunea ?n manualul dar nu am g?sit nici o sigl?).I tried to open an account and register to even use this app for my new washer but it come back saying my email address is already in use so use another one. I dont have another one so i cant even use this apo.Too difficult to log on, register. Fails forcing you to read 20 pages of useless legal garbage. Returned unit to store. App loads virus and malware upon install. Shame on you LG, putting spyware on peopkes devices to use a product u sell as profit.I can\\'t figure out how to show when my washer/dryer is running and how to control it from my phone. I downloaded the washer and dryer to my account but it is not displaying the status on my washer/dryer. Don\\'t understand this app. All I can do is download cycles and t hats it.Disappointed. Would expect to be able to customize a wash cycle to my own preferences..My product is unavailable although my top load washer have smarthinQ logo. Please help me solve the problem. Thankyou LG.The app refuses to let me use the currently installed version and instead wants to force me into upgrading to the new version with some new terms of service use..Get the error fixed that does not allow it to connect without LTE off.Not able to register my new oven equiped with TagOn. I have a LG3 phone with NFC on. This doesn\\'t work, it\\'s useless.Garbage. Too bad they aren\\'t a multi billion dollar company so they could invest in some Research and Development to make it better.doesnt communicate neither google home/alexa and smart home hub.Don\\'t get notifications anymore when washing or drying is complete, please fix. Alert settings are turned ON!.Using vivo y51 to installed apps. White screen after click start button. Should i draw something?.The idiots who built this App, I pick a front load washer, and then they ask what model is my \"refrigerator\"?!!!.I am not able to login through the app. Shows just the white blank screen forever!!.Very bad app in world kuch ope. Hi nahi ho raha hain yar.I can\\'t connect my phone to the laundry even while following the instructions. Very upset..Total spyware garbage.  Failed with my oven, dishwasher, and refrigerator..Gives the following error on my device \"The crosswalk project service must be updated\".Complete piece of excrement. I own an IT company and I can\\'t get this AC to connect..I cannot get my portable AC to register!!  I tried reinstalling but that didn\\'t help.  Fix it..It will not connect to my washer or dryer. My router is brand new and not far from the w/d at all. I\\'ve uninstalled the app and reinstalled it and few times but it still won\\'t connect. It wasn\\'t a selling point for the washer and dryer anyway but since it the option I was hoping to use it..I had an error on startup, but after a reinstall, it worked, thank you..I have an LG AC. I cannot switch modes from the app, it keeps coming back to the previous mode....Asks for crazy permissions and requires me to reconfigure my WiFi! Identified my washing machine as a fridge..I have no option shown after downloading the app to find my WiFi network and enter a password.  I can\\'t find anything that points in the right direction to do a search..Why would this app need to make calls and manage calls.My machine is not as advanced as the sales man promised..Old app worked fine. Nothing bit trouble with this app and takes to long to log in (if it logs in) to turn on aircond.Why do I need to create LG accout to use? Thank you but no..Love it.  Had no problems installing and connecting to my AT&T Wi-Fi network.  Steps were easy..Why the f**k does this app require location permission and phone status!??!?.Desperately need to add cool down function to cycles and allow custom cycles by customers..Your app wants to take control of my phone.No matter what I do, my refrigerator product registration says it fails..Can\\'t complete even product registration.Doesn\\'t connect..Can\\'t use.Nice application.Inconvenient.Awful awful app! Found my tag on washing machine but won\\'t register it or connect to it! My phone is absolutely fine but keeps on saying connection error with the app and to check MY internet connection. Very disappointed. Bought this washing machine thinking I can download extra cycles! Never thought I won\\'t even be able to get on the app! Very poor LG.Doesn\\'t work period, it\\'s IP address never changes to local wireless router configuration therefore you can\\'t access it. Wasted two hours with this useless. BTW all my network devices work just fine..Why do you require access to my location and media files as well as the ability to manage phone calls? I\\'m unable to even open the app when denying these permissions.  None of the functionality I intended to use would have required any of those permissions,  as I only want to use this app to configure my washing machine through NFC. So why can\\'t you let me do that, and only ask for the other permissions when I use the other functionality that actually needs these permissions?.As many people have said, this app does not work at all and is very disheartening. The previous versions of the app never worked for me, immediately upon opening the app would go black and force quit. The newest version of the app still does not work, yet this version now displays an unknown app error code - 1000. I tried removing and reinstalling the app multiple times. I am very disappointed in the quality of work from LG and feel cheated that I purchased the wireless version of the A/C unit.  Unacceptable!.Useless. Constant app execution errors. Cannot connect. Absolutely useless. If I could give less than one star I would..App just dropped my appliances (after six months). Trying to decide if it\\'s worth trying again. For me, the older as was more reliable..I just got a new phone and it will not connect to my phone. Not happy at all..Unknown error code during application run : -1000  What \\'s happend with my phone (lg g3 cat 6 -f460s) I can not open it to use my washes.After recent update it no longer connects to my air conditioner!!!!.Error code during application run -1000. I have send you the email.Stupid app won\\'t even open.Agreed with previous post. Says cant connect. :(.Permission list is ridiculous for this app. All you want to do is use the NFC tagging to customize what you\\'re doing with the product. Why the hell is there so many permissions? Tired of companies stealing private information to resell to third parties. That is the only reason they have so many permission requirements. It\\'s even hilarious how they block you from using the app if you don\\'t allow the permissions. No meta data is absolutely anonymous. GPS data especially. Do not install this app and grant those permissions..I paid extra for the ability to have a washer and dryer connected to my network so that we can tell where the process is at for washing and drying. I tried many times to get this to work I called customer support many times and they have no clue as to how it should work LG is failing the customer and the consumer with non-functional application. I will rate the LG washer and dryer as one star on every single website I go to and I will explain that LG can\\'t make their application work..Bring back the old version that worked, who made this decision to upgrade this application should find another job soon before He or She got fired.  What a terrible QA job! They just want to kill LG brand for sure.  Please read the Users reviews for this App, you will find that everyone complaint about it.  Please change back to the previous working version that cam with the Refrigerator (2yrs. ago)  Thanks!.Same problem. Portable AC (lp1414wxrsm) claims that register is complete regardless if wifi access point is on or off. But nothing shows up under registered  or dashboard. Seems to be a glitch within the app. Not sure if this matters but I\\'m in Canada. Please respond!.Why do the app use over 200MB of space? Kind of waste, because the app isn\\'t that much of use. Would be better to download just the necessary modules for my washing machine than to have everything LG has ever produced through time.The way the menus work is quite counterintuitive. I would also like to know what the different sycles I can download onto my washer do beforehand. Now I have to test them one by one. It would be nice to have some customisation available for the sycles too..Old app worked a treat. Product won\\'t register. Absolutely useless now. Paid extra for wifi dongle that\\'s gathering dust. Lift your gane LG.Read Terms & Conditions carefully. They want to collect text msg, voice, IMEI, IP addresses, and other personal information. Seriously. Our privacy is really just free these days to corporations? I will not be using this. And I\\'m not surprised but I\\'m really disgusted with requesting that intimate of detail..Just download this NEW SmartthinQ app to a Samsung Galaxy 5 to use with my new washer/dryer delivered yesterday and its useless. Promoted as \\'snart\\' but its far from it! It won\\'t perform any of the functions that LG promote on the website e.g. remote operation, calendar for tub clean and more importantly will not let you download wash cycles which is partvreason for purchase! There are no features that you can access except for showing you a pointless picture of the appliance! Quality control is needed by the developer as LG are promising something they cannot deliver.  Look at all the other negative reviews, very poor!.Have a new Port A/C. Last step takes forever to register then says it has, but no product show up when done. Fix please!  I\\'m using an Android Pixel.  I see also see no response from any of the poor ratingssl I\\'m sure this is going absolutely nowhere so at least your consistent with your app. Good work! Especially for a tech company..Like other users are saying: bring back the Smart Laundry app! I bought a washing machine with the promise of extra functionality, only to have these extra functions taken away within months from the date of purchase! And if I want this back, I have to give you access to all kinds of details of my personal life?! No thank you, LG, this was the last time you got my money! (and yes, I do understand why some functionality - e.g., calling a technician - might require certain permissions; however, you could give users an option to use these functions in the app or not, instead of just bluntly demanding permission for functions we/I don\\'t need) (and who wants to have an app decide which technician to call anyway??).Tap On doesn\\'t work so app is useless. Samsung Galaxy 7 phone.   Edit: finally got Tap On to work by taking the cover off my phone and holding the phone in a horizontal position. But, since my washer isn\\'t Wi-Fi enabled, the app is still almost useless.   I can download ONE custom wash setting, but the list you choose from doesn\\'t describe the setting so it\\'s just a guessing game.  And supposedly the app will tell me when it\\'s time to run the drum clean cycle, but in order for it to know that I would have to take off my phone cover and tap my phone again so it can count how many wash cycles we\\'ve been through, and I just don\\'t think I\\'ll bother. Much easier just to make a calendar reminder.  The function I really wanted -- knowing how long before the wash is done -- I can\\'t have since this isn\\'t a Wi-Fi machine. Wish I\\'d known all this before I purchased..I was expecting the app to ask permission to access NFC. Instead, it asked for contacts and calls access, gps and storage and media files. I will not give access to this app to these functions. Ever! Reduce the amount of permissions and maybe I will get back to it..Updated to the new app for my Wine Cellar A.C. unit. Will not connect, extremely disappointed as now I cannot control the temperature. Bring back the old or fix the thing. Also called the support line and they stated tech support would within 3 days of the call. So far...  10 business days and no call??.Application non fonctionnelle. Installation ok, d?marrage de l\\'application pendant 1 seconde puis error -1000.... Update toujours inutile...Please update this app! It doesn\\'t even want to connect to my washer and dryer. It didn\\'t work for my sister in laws washer and dryer either. Would absolutely LOVE this feature if it just worked..Tag on will not work. I\\'ve been over all the tutorials, using Huawei Mate 9. NFC is working just fine in all except connecting to washer / drier..Massively invasive permissions, and hangs on final step of registration. This app is the only way tobuse my $200 ac dongle... So out $200... Also WiFi not even option on cassette style ac units.Have LG G10 smartphone app does not recognize my lg password...so, can\\'t log on. Also, won\\'t let me reset password. ??.Old one worked with my Tag On washer, this one doesn\\'t and asks to access ask kinds of stuff on my phone. Gone..Sinceinstalling the new version i cant usethe downloadable cycles cant use the old app either so im stuck fix it!.I also don\\'t understand why the app asks for so many permissions..After it pissed me off for a min i got it to work when i uninstalldd and reinstalled. I hate that it need so many damn permissions to work..Absolute garbage. Doesn\\'t connect or work at all. What a useless app and useless feature.Just got an LG fridge today it\\'s a lfxs30766 and i can\\'t get it to connect to the Wi-Fi absolutely useless.\"This app doesn\\'t works I\\'am taping it    5 time but the app doesn\\'t responds.\".does not work. \"connection to the server was unsuccessful\".You have all these washing spin cycles to download with zero information. How about including details.Congratulations,  it seems all issues fixed at least for Europe.I have updated my review because the app seems to be working with my A/C unit now..It doesn\\'t matter how many times you follow the instructions,  this app never pulls up!.Does not sync with AC. Does not work!.It doesn\\'t support smart diagnosis on the dishwashers.This new app will not connect to my account unit. Bring back the old app..permissions, account creation, just bad.I can\\'t even create a custom cycle on my washer and dryer to upload to them..Great for notifications, keeps you from having to visually check when laundry is done. Support is great!.Doesn\\'t even let me create an account.After last update the app won\\'t start.Can not open the application.Great app!!!.Nice.So far so good. The NFC worked great for me. I didn\\'t have to take the case off my phone like I\\'ve read others have. I\\'m still learning, I just got it. But the last two reviews don\\'t seem accurate. Maybe they have iphones.... iPhone don\\'t have NFC.LG wants into your personal data with this application which is highly inappropriate, realize the early adopters are often the most savvy user base.  Also realize that this user base is likely more skilled than your internal developers. No f\\'ing way LG you can have precise location, contact list, files and photos so I can remotely control my washer and drawer said nobody.   Application refuses to run without these permissions which is bs because I\\'m happy with the unit is otherwise..So, to understand your decision making; you had an app that worked and provided useful feedback to customers. Then willingly decided to change the app so it doesn\\'t work at all in any aspect and offers less functionality while also being buggy and requiring an immense amount of permissions. I have to think whoever made the decision probably made a good bonus too and is laughing at the incompetence of LG. And the only response from LG ignores 90% of the issues listed..Connects fine to my washer with Tag On. However, you can only download cycles that are already in the app. The machine has 9+ built in cycles. Not sure I\\'ll ever need any of the app\\'s additional cycles, but would definitely like a spin-only, or ability to create that..A good idea bit could be implemented better. App is clunky, takes forever to load. Feels like the app is a data mine. What does owning a washing machine have to do with my privacy and personal details??.Tried every possible way to get to view whatever the washer is doing. The only thing you can do with this App in Canada is download  a specific cycle.. which is totally useless.Cannot get NFC connection with my expensive Tag On washer and dryer. Feeling I\\'m not getting the value for my hard-earned money. ??.Just downloaded this for my new washer. As previous reviewers, I was also negatively surprised with number of permissions required. Then I tried to log-in with existing LG name and password, but it didn\\'t allow - the username already exists (of course, it does, I have been a loyal LG client with many products - will I be after that?). But the major disappointment was that you can\\'t create your own cycle, just download some really strange ones. With more than 10 cycles already? Useless. But I still hope that LG can improve this one....My fridge was obviously broken (Not cooling any compartment) yet this app said all was fine! Telling me I open and close the doors more/less than average is worthless data. Also, I\\'m a little worried when the update fixes \"competibility\" problems. Can\\'t even spell right?.Irrelevant permissions block the usage of this app. At least offer me an explanation as to what you\\'re going to use my information for!.Totally worthless.  Dryer will not shut off even though control panel is off.  Diagnostics indicates no problems.  Obviously WRONG..Really useless app. Taking space on my phone is all it does. I just purchased a new washer and dryer with tag on but doesn\\'t even work with this app..Very intrusive app (call data, GPS, media library), considering its only purpose is provide appliance status and remote functions..The app is so easy to use. I had to check that I was using it right, if it was really that simple. It was. The thing is it does absolutely nothing..Why do you need all these permissions to turn on my portable A/C unit? Shady Brady..Works well with my window a.c. units. Easy to setup. Will give 5 stars if a scheduled program is added. Currently can turn on/off after x hours but would like to control temps -time-days..Refuses to work if I don\\'t give it permissions it obviously shouldn\\'t need.Useless applications at all.Didn\\'t even load.Useless.The previous app was better. This new one doesn\\'t keep track of wash cycles. Tub clean guide is useless, tells you each time that tub clean is required even if you had just done the tub clean cycle. App is slow and bloated..App continually fails to open. Phone is not rooted, portable AC has good Wi-Fi signal. The previous standalone version worked well, this does not. I will not install it again until they release an update. I am on a Note 5 with Android 7.0. Why can\\'t we still use the old version? It is listed in the play store, by just redirects to the new version when I try to install. Bad move LG, I will not be a satisfied customer until you fix this..Won\\'t connect to my product that dirctss me to the app in the instruction manual.  My air conditioner LS091GSV3 is already ignoring the remote and blinking like an idiot ob my wall.  Your app fails. Your product is not performing the tall it was designed for.Using front load washer.  The app is truly useless.   To be useful you need to be able to create new cycles including heat, spin, soil, water use, number of rinses.  Instead, this app provides no ability to customize.  Useless and embarrassing..Totally useless app. Took forever and multiple attempts to register both front load washer and dryer. Older app had ability to use a quiet mode for night washing, was removed. App takes way to long to start up..I was about to give 5 but until issue is resolved 2 will remain. I just purchased brand new LG refrigerator with all brand new features but I am unable to register it. My washer is ok working responding to NFC but refirg. is not registeribg. Please assist..It kept popping up a message telling me a new spill is easier to clean than an old spill.  And it was not simply a notification it was a pop-up that would take over the screen..If it would open maybe i could give it a higher rating.  I bought the washing machine partly because of the app functionality - silly me, should have reviewed comments and rating first!!!!.Useless.  Will not get another smart LG item.  Will probably return the air conditioner.Could do with more programs that reverse tumble ,  my heat pump dryer RC9055AP2F doesn\\'t reverse tumble on most of the programmes,   bedding, curtains and throws go into a ball because of the lack of reverse function,  im sick of taking things out to untangle them all the time..This app is completely useless! The download function no longer works from the recent update. I thought LG was at the forefront of technology, but I guess wrong..Fails 9/10 tag ons on a good day. Stops at either 30% or 60%. Extremely and ridiculously frustrating..Is there a store demo mode like the old app? I work at a retail store that sells LG appliances and I can\\'t show customers how it works without registering a unit. Thanks.Useless after successfully getting the nfc and washer to connect does absolutely nothing but tell me to download cycles I don\\'t want vs info about load currently running.This app is terrible main reason I bought this air conditioner was.for WiFi.How is it my $2k washer does not connect to the app/wifi, but I can buy a $10 adapter that does in one click??.Does not work with my lg v20. Garbage..Hooked my phone right up to my AC. Three easy steps.. Now I can control it from wherever. Not sure why there are so many bad reviews..Doesn\\'t work. Wasted money on the wifi feature. Same AC without wifi was $40 less..Won\\'t connect to fridge. Fridge times out everytime..Won\\'t connect to my air conditioner..Brand new machine, not supported...Total rubbish for TagOn devices.This app will not open have had enough reinstalled it three times Samsung S8.Didn\\'t connect, instructions don\\'t match the buttons on the dryer..Can\\'t connect my washer and dryer at all..I have to sign up for an LG account before I can use it? No thanks..Doesn\\'t work.I got a new phone so I had to download this app again and I was shocked to see it only has a 2.3 rating. I love it! I can put my load in the washer when I leave for work but start it remotely later in the day so it\\'s ready for the dryer when I get home. And it will notify me when either unit is done no matter what I am! Great app, one of the reasons we bought these units..I like that I don\\'t have to log in each time, unlike using the previous app. BUT I don\\'t like its requirement for phone and file system access. We should have a choice of skipping the features that require access. Just as annoying, the new app doesn\\'t run on my Nexus 9 tablet even though the old one did. So much for the convenience of being able to control my LG devices from around my house unless I want to carry my phone wherever I go..Yep, its complete garbage.   Registered my new W&D set on the LG website, then downloaded the app. Went to log in -- wouldn\\'t accept my login (I tried multiple times). So I made a local account instead. Tried to add both appliances via \"Tag on\" -- no matter how many times I tried, it wouldn\\'t add either one. Even took the case off my phone. It did recognize the smart diagnosis chime, but that didn\\'t give me access to any of these smart features. Why buy a $700 appliance that gives you everything a $400 one does?.Why in the world does this app need to manage my calls, files, make calls and the like?  It needs access to photos, media and files?  Invade privacy much?  I will not use an app for laundry that is this invasive. If the rating system had negative numbers, that is how I would rate it just based on those factors.  That\\'s ludicrous..I just signed up for a US account, although I\\'m in Canada, reinstalled the app, which I also had to choose USA as country. But this time SUCCESS! I was told that LG doesn\\'t have a Canadian Smart Thing server, so this appears to be a workaround... until they change something else!.This app is very bad. I keep getting a  product registration failure when I try to connect with my air conditioner. Instructions are vague and I tried contacting smart thing Q and I have not received a response. I will not buy LG products any more..Is a great app when it works. After last update keep getting error message \"smart think app failed execution. Try again\" with choice to cancel or retry. Please get this problem fixed. Also keeps saying washer/dryer is disconnected when I know it is running and connected. as of 1.11.2019 this app asked to read new privacy and something else updates and agree to it. I did that now I get a screen up that has a ! in a red phone shaped icon and the wording below it is in Chinese. APP now useless..The app wants permissions to make phone calls?  Seriously?  Okay, decided to allow it for the sake of testing.  Then the application will not run because the phone is rooted.  I develop code for Android and have my phone rooted for a reason.  I understand why financial won\\'t allow transactions on rooted phones, but can anyone at LG give me a reasonable business case for your laundry application refusing to run because my phone is rooted?  Inane.  Edit:  In response to LG\\'s response.  Specifically, what \"law of increased security\".  The only laws of which I am aware are those designed to protect my private data.  How does refusal to run on a rooted phone impact this?  More importantly, how does requiring that your application have access to photos, contacts, mail and phone functions in any way support the fantasy that LG invokes these measures for \"security\".  Please..Tried to connect our brand new top load washer two a few different phones and nothing ever worked. Almost got it to connect once and then it said that there was an error and it erased all the information. Our Wi-Fi connection is great and have no network issues. This is how I know that it is the software\\'s fault. This app is garbage.My dishwasher with \"smart diagnosis\" logo doesn\\'t support \"Smart ThinQ\" app. This was a selling point when l purchased the dishwasher 3 years ago and it isn\\'t supported now that I need it. I\\'m very disappointed and will purchase accordingly in the future. The 2.3 start rating for this app should be of concern to LG as it reflects very low customer satisfaction..This had been favorite part of my new washer and dryer. The latest update removed my appliances and i can\\'t pairing again. pairing process doesn\\'t find anything. So frustrating!.Worked somewhat well until I got a new router and had to try to change my network. App gave me no option to do so, so I deleted the appliance and tried to readd it, but the WiFi will not connect to my new network. Can\\'t find any tutorials for this issue. Very disappointing to have a \"smart\" appliance not smart enough to connect to my WiFi.  Response to LG: My router offers both and I can see the proper network to connect to, I select it, put in the password, hit connect, then on the next screen it says to press the button on the fridge panel for 3 seconds until it flashes, and I do, but it never connects. The WiFi button flashes off and on for a minute or so, and then stops and it never connects..Tried new app, doesn\\'t get beyond connecting attempt with wifi flashing. Chatted with tech support but told my phone isn\\'t compatible with the app..Completely unusable! Demands way too many permissions to install, then quits when it tries to communicate with an apparently nonexistent server. Bring back the old app that worked!.The instructions on registration of washing may could be better, finally was able to register my washing machine and now it works.  What the instructions don\\'t tell what to do.  Follow these instructions and you\\'ll be able to use this app as per the previous version.   To Register product click the 3 dots top right of the screen - press register product - it should ask if your washing machine either has the \"smart Thinq logo\" or \"Tag on logo\" - choose which ever you have - I chose \"Tag on\" as that\\'s what I have - then I followed the instructions on phone to connect.  It would have been a lot better of LG to make registering product as seemed as the previous version..This app does not have half the cycles the previous one had. Upgrades are suppose to improve things not make them poorer. Very disappointing from LG. Please sort this out..Only usable to do new wash load cycle.  Waste of space on my phone.  Almost as bad as the smart diagnostic app.Would love to stop wasting time but the app takes so long to load that I waste more time waiting for it to start up. The download via nfc is too finicky which takes more time to upload settings..Should\\'ve left it alone. I can\\'t register my washer with NFC on the new app because when I try it just takes me too the old Smart Laundry app. Please fix. Very dissapointed.Old app worked perfectly. Forced to update and now wont connect using NFC, all I can do is run smart diagnostics..So I have an HTC desire 626, and once I opened the app it takes me to these options of either an LG account login or a \"simple login\" and every time I clicked on either one it takes me to a blank white page that allows me to zoom in out on that white page. So, what\\'s up with the app?.Very disappointing why does LG need to know my location my phone calls and my pictures in order to control my washing machine I will not give these permissions.My teenage daughter hates that I know when she is doing laundry, and when she\\'s not, lol! I love it!.Over $2000.00 for a new LG washer and dryer set and this app and its features do not work. The units connect to the app over wi-fi, but other than merely stopping the cycle on the units, nothing else functions. What a waste!  The app could not even find the registration of the units, and had to be completed a second time within the app. A waste of my time and whatever LG adds to the price of these units for nonoperational features..Rubbish. Requires all if your information (including date of birth) and runs like garbage. Pull up your socks, LG..Doesn\\'t work. Can\\'t even get to log in. Worthless download.This app can not find my LG fridge what can I do, I did  by nfc and tap on fridge the app can not find.  Some body help me.Agree with another\\'s \"still sluggish\" comment but I\\'ve noticed an improvement..Useless app ,hassle to register just to access tech support ,and find out they have ZERO tech support.server keeps going down, why does it need a server?.This is BS.....my app updated and now it won\\'t work at all..Won\\'t load beyond 70% when held to the\"Tag On\" position....complete waste of time..My tag doesn\\'t seem to work any more.Concerning.... Why would this app ever need access to my contacts or photos?!.The old app was much better this one is ok but not as effective in diagnosing the problem..Cannot run on rooted platform! Seriously ??? This app is a joke, well done LG..Just crap!.Forced No root? Lol 1 star.Can\\'t run on rooted platform..Why is aircon not included?.Just works!.Why login.Very Disappointed. The old app that worked well has been discontinued and will only open the new app. I can only find one washer function on the new app, and it doesn\\'t seem to have most of the things the old app had. There is more to the privacy policy than to the app itself. This app needs some major UX work.   I do appreciate the response from the developer, but apps shouldn\\'t require documentation, the UI should be designed so it is not needed. I could use the old app without extra instructions..Useless.  Requires access to my location, ability to make phone calls, and access to all my store files.   Ummm, no.  It should not need these privileges to let me control my washer via near field.  It will not run at all without these privileges.  No thank you.  Uninstalling....Latest version is similar to the original  (which was very good), EXCEPT  that it provides no details. I.e. you can choose  \"overnight dry\" or \"denim\", but until it is loaded to the washer or dryer, the user has no idea what settings that entails (and there\\'s no provision to modify the downloads)..What am I missing? I was only able to link my washer and dryer to my phone/app but after that, nothing. Was really looking forward to cool features. Is this app currently being worked on or something? VERY DISAPPOINTING..It works. It is less intuitive than the old app. Took a while to find all the downloadable options for my washer, then to discover nothing new, except the app is 5.3 times larger in size on my phone..Rediculous! I don\\'t have WiFi at my house. I just use my phone and I can\\'t use the app to register? My phone has Internet! Should be able to type in a serial number and go. What the hell kind do of app is this? My phone has WiFi and Internet with mobile Hotspot! You need to redesign your app to be able to use the phone WiFi to talk to my washer and send data over the mobile network at the same time.Old app worked fine. Now it doesn\\'t run and tells me to get the new app. The new app crashes as soon as you launch it, stating that it can\\'t run on rooted devices. Stay away from LG\\'s crappy \"smart\" platform..This is a useless app. My kids ant squashing app accomplishes more. It seriously makes me rethink everything about LG. I would never buy one of their \"smart\" phones due to this stupid app..Why would this app for a washing machine want my phone information, make calls and location? Other than to download new wash cycle types, it has no purpose..Worked perfectly yesterday for my first time using it. Not so much today. It freezes at 70%.Uninstalled right away. I wanted this to manage my LG appliances and it wants access to my photos, phone calls...location I can understand, but not the rest..I couldn\\'t get the app to work with my aircon. I rang LG and a few days later it works, so if you\\'re having trouble just call. App does what it\\'s meant to with controlling aircon remotely..Cannot even connect, just sits on the \\'trying to connect screen\\' forever. Just awful.It is imposible to download programs to washer dryer, errors at 70%.Waste of time. Couldn\\'t communicate with machine.Wanted to see what this would do with the fridge, not enough to go through setting up an account though..Was able to download, but at login, only got a white screen, couldn\\'t login..Tried multiple phones and won\\'t connect to any of them. Dryer is 2 days old.I have washer and dryer combo but won\\'t find dryer.... why.ok thanks now app is working.Bought a fancy dancy new dishwasher. Reading the manual, it said there is an app for more features. I thought \\'cool!\\' i download the app and go through the steps to register with NFC... \\'Your product is not supported\\'. What? If you are going to mention the app in the manual, and actually put the tap on function on the product, customers are going to expect the app to do something. LDF5545ST. Top notch sorry though. Got a response almost immediately. When the initial fix still didn\\'t work they tried again  and I can see the additional cycles avail for our machine..It initially didnt work on my s7. And the advise on updating webview is correct but missing the fact that if you have chrome installed, this may prevent you from updating / enabling webview. What you need to do is disable chrome, go to playstore and update/enable webview, install smart thinq, then enable chrome again. That made mine work..Well, it doesn\\'t recognise my existing LG log in details so had to set up another account. I think it would be useful if these accounts were linked. After setting up additional account it works ok. The app should say that you cannot use your existing account..First off it won\\'t recognize my existing MyLG login credentials.  Since it won\\'t let me log in and presumably access my product registration isn\\'t doing anything for me.  No indication on the fridge that WiFi is active after the initiial blinking.  Didn\\'t really need my fridge to track my location, snoop my contacts and make calls on my behalf.  Deleting app.  May try later..Old app worked fine for my air conditioners. New app has a terrible interface and less options than the original. And since the last update with the new app, it doesn\\'t even open! It shows the \"Smart ThinQ\" opening screen and doesn\\'t go any further. Worst app ever!  UPDATE - uninstalled and re installed the app, got to the page with the \"start\" button, clicked that and it got stuck on a loading screen, closed and re opened the app and it went back to getting stuck on the main title page. Awful app!  Australia.Disappointing and useless selection of download cycles for my dishwasher without specifying what they do. For example, what does \"Rainy season\" washing mean?? What does \"kids clothes\" do differently than normal 60 degree washing? Most importantly, where is the option of making your own washing cycles!?.This has to be the worst app ever it\\'s completely useless.... it Does not have near as many features as the old app that this one replaced and 90% of the time it never works... I have to reload my washer every time... And for some reason I just sit waiting for 10 mins for the app to even open it just sits on a buffering screen saying it\\'s downloading product info... Totally useless and worthless.Useless. Why can\\'t I define a custom wash cycle for my washer? The only options you offer are \"small load\" or \"single garment\". Let me create a custom profile with access to ALL the options, otherwise what\\'s the point??.Bought a new washing machine - very expensive but seemed to be the best of the best.  I installed this app\\' and it won\\'t even connect to the washer.  Both my phone and the washing machine sit there saying \"Trying to connect\" but neither does anything.  Perhaps I should have bought a different brand.  Not impressed with this app at all..The old app worked great. Opened the new app and it had a random washer and dryer but said they weren\\'t connected to wifi. Deleted them and tried to re-register, but it won\\'t let me. So now useless..Doesn\\'t work. Bring back the old lg ac app. Pathetic.  Now i cant control my 3 aircons in my business. UPDATE: i have upgraded my phone from Samsung to a Sony.  The app works fine on my new phone but not the old one even though it\\'s fully updated..I had LG Smart AC which worked but was forced to upgrade to this which doesn\\'t work at all ( blank screen ). Now I can\\'t control my ac via Wifi!!!! Pretty standard phone I\\'m running. Samsung Galaxy Note 4. Update. ... needed to update Web view as suggested in another negative review ... sorted now.No way to download a wool wash or hand wash to my washing machine which was the only reason I downloaded the app.  Edit: Regarding your reply, it is not true - the only garment protection is a colour protection. There are only 2 fabric protection options: jeans or blanket. If you search wool nothing comes up. I emailed that address several weeks ago but have not had a reply..the old app worked great for my washer and dryer. it forced me to upgrade to this new one and it is completely useless. it gives no stats for my appliances and only has a few cycles to download. I will uninstall it since it has no benefits that i can see..This app is unusable.  It was working fine with previous version.  It stopped connecting to the washer and dryer.  I\\'ve tried uninstall, reinstall the application per instruction.  It will not connect.  I keep getting registration failure in the app.  The mobile notification feature was one of the main features why I pay the extra money for.  Now I just have an expensive washer and dryer that does not provide the feature and functionality that it was marketed for.  Please fix this app asap.  If not, I\\'m sure there will be enough people with the same issues that will be interested in filling a class action lawsuit for false advertisement..Was working.  Then stopped working.  Wifi turned off or disconnected with the refrigerator.  What do I do! I really want this app to work..Absolute junk. Managed to always find the fridge but it never registered always giving me error. Not much help available to correct this. Don\\'t waste your time..This app does not work. It will not connect to the appliances. LG customer support stated today that it is a known software issue and the developer is working on it but has no time frame when when it will be up and running. The website has the same issue..No longer useful. Does not have any wash cycles which are worth using. Old app had been very good..Can not find the machine .your instruction do not have manual settings. Is the machine should be on or off. !!!! Called LG they said the app dp not work in Canada yet !!! Funny so long paid for something which is not available in Canada yet One of the manager told to wait as they are trying to fix the problem .did they wait to take my money!!! I think that it is a scam from LG To grab extra money for feature which does not work..Why the loss of features?? With the old washer/dryer app you could see stats and have more options for wash or dry cycles. This new app is garbage. Please fix.Old AC app was rubbish and slow, this app just goes to a white screen after loading  ....poor effort by LG app team once again, 2.4 stars for a large company app is embarrassing..This app does not even work! I even updated my phone from sony to oneplus 3T and i still can\\'t get past the opening page. Why can\\'t you just bring the old app back???.Horrible \"app\"  crashes everytime I open it right after download.  Uninstalled and reinstalled- same issue..app crashes and I have tons of internal memory available.  Junk.Keeps on crashing with \"client cannot be reached\" LG should make a diagnosis app for the diagnosis app and stop promoting devices using this. Very disappointed!.Cant even register a washer or dryer with tag on.  Washer or dryer just beeps like crazy with no response on app other that to touch the phone to the device..After update won\\'t connect to my AC model no. R24AWN-NC13 (ASNW246C2R4) Tried to reset wifi but won\\'t register the product. Not Good..Update: didn\\'t work for several months, then suddenly worked for 4 days. But now it\\'s back to no longer working..Doesn\\'t work on rooted devices! Seriously LG?? 1st I download the old app as per my new appliances instructions. It turns out I used 30MB of data just so it can tell me too download the new app. If it\\'s redundant, why is it still available? Now this app which is newer and twice the size is still useless! C\\'mon LG, get it together!!.Only works with device that has nfc connection cant communicate with my dishwasher not happy my phone is oppo r7sf.This app is a little hard to figure out but customer service was great on answering any questions I had. Now that I know how to use it. I like it..Shame on ypu LG.  Thought his app will work, need runtime app also, why the hell. Show washing cycle direct..Now that I can open the app I can\\'t register my stove and use the tag on feature.  Get it together....Will connect to my washing machine. But it won\\'t connect to the dryer. Tried everything possible but it won\\'t work.It would be nice if the description above actually told you what the App is actually supposed to do instead of being completely fluff marketing copy that tells me zero about why I should waste my time and space downloading their app..The app works for the washer wm9000hmv but not the matching dryer dlex9000v. Why is that?.\"Prohibited registration information\" trying to add my fridge. App doesn\\'t even ask to tap the NFC. Simply useless..Can\\'t get it to recognize my new lg washer and dryer on my htc10.  Really disappointed..Won\\'t even let me log in. LG, get it right. Last version worked..Need me to register product. But why isn\\'t there aircon??.Will not load my airconditioner.  Very frustrating..This app can\\'t even connect to my brand new washer and dryer. The NFC won\\'t connect to either my phone, my wife\\'s phone, or any other phone we have tried. And it isn\\'t the phones, NFC weeks for with other apps..Won\\'t work with my phone.. the old app worked fine but forced to use this one which sucks!.App doesn\\'t work on rooted devices, FAIL!.Worst app... doesn\\'t even work just a plain white screen....I just bought a new LG washer and dryer. We did a diagnosis of the machine and it said it had no problems.  Was kinda cool..Nothing shown at all after clicking start button on welcome page at HTC one m9 Android version 6 & 7.can not connect to my washer because i have rooted devices. what the hell decision.I have yet to meet anyone that is able to get the LG smart appliances to register on their phones..Can make my own cycles; like an only spin cycle and also the pairing instructions suck.Won\\'t let me log in at all. Galaxy S7 with NFC  enabled..Cant run on root devices. Ty.Great app, usefull. Like my new washer! :).Garbage app.Bad bad.Very good.Crap.LG need to rethink how they package their apps! I don\\'t want to give all those permissions just to let to my washer dryer! Get smart laundry app running again before you start losing customers to Samsung who can do apps properly..After i installed  Smart laundry  i need to update to this.  Application doesn\\'t work on rooted phones? Yes, they exist to many customers.  Why your application need permission to Calls, modify  editing contacts, take pictures...? It\\'s only needed NFC. Rework to your application. Creators of that app need to be fired. Check all reviews also for Laundry app..Just spent over 20 minutes with LG support. They could not resolve why the app would not let me download cycles. The \"tag on\" function allowed me to register my dishwasher. But I kept getting \"Tag On Failed\" message. Also, there is no area of the app that you can adjust Settings as described in the Owners Manual..Terrible! Rotten! Garbage!  Bought top of the line clothes washer and dryer under the pitch of smart appliances.  Worked just fine with the earlier Laundry App.  Forced upgrade and the product does not even register anymore - get a message saying that the product is not supported by ThinQ!  Terrible! Rotten! Garbage!.So the old laundry app used to work just fine. Now I\\'m forced to upgrade and to use this one, except it doesn\\'t work on rooted devices. Awesome. I bought my washer and dryer for the ability to download cycles and now I can\\'t do that because of this. Thanks LG. In all seriousness why do you care if my device is rooted. Please fix this issue promptly..When it asks me to log in, I only get a blank screen.  I\\'ve uninstalled, reinstalled, rebooted, always with the same result.  The app that I used back in 2013 was much better.  Waste of time trying to troubleshoot my dishwasher..It does not give more time with family as it promises, it gives less. It takes forever to load, it at all. Nice idea. But it is a fail until LG fix it. The app it replaced worked really well. How about more product testing before your next app goes live?.Just wanted tag on to control my ovens settings - told me to install this ... This app does not support tag on for ovens. It was a waste of my time even downloading it.Total Rubbish! I bought my washer with the intention of being able to use the downloades and also the tag on  diagnoses. Huh! Bought the washer in September and now a waste of money.....Unsuccessful NFC tag on while registering my product. I think the device is expecting me to be a precise targets man to line up my phone against the tag on. Once I accomplish that after say a 2-3 minutes of struggle the connection is so sensitive that the app gives up after 30% progress each time. The diagnosis I suppose is that the phone moved while the connection was established. LG you\\'d be better off providing a magnet for sticking my phone. Too difficult for my phone atleast..I have downloaded, installed, and reinstalled several time and cannot get my refrigerator to register and app to work. I get through all the steps and the product registration fails. I sent an email previously and did not get any reply, so for me this app is useless..Won\\'t load up. Click on start and all I get is a plain white screen. Tried to uninstall and reinstall several times. Wanted to download a wash program and can\\'t do it as it won\\'t load.Seems like a simple bait and switch to me. Ordered a washer/dryer set with wifi features advertised. Turns out the company takes away the app without bothering to update its manuals (which still instruct users to dl the Smart Laundry app), and leave us with an app with exactly one cycle choice I don\\'t use. Glad the appliances work, because the app is utterly worthless..Just got this dryer download the app after finding out the name had changed. Did have to update my Android web viewer for the app to work correctly so far so good with downloading new drying Cycles..I have LG model WM9000HA washer and model DLGX9001 dryer.  I registered both and they are recognized and connected to my WIFI, but always says they are off when I use them.  The older app worked great..Nice idea, but the removal of some cycles that were present in the old app is very disappointing..This app only has limited selections for the devices it \"supports\".  Imagine a TV remote that only turned on & off the device -- no channel selection or volume control.  That\\'s what this is like.  It\\'s a waste of time.  Don\\'t bother with it..I HATE this version. I have no idea why they had to change it. The previous version was so much better. I actually loved it and used it all the time. This one is craaaap!.Old app worked just fine. This one just fails to register my air con. Wish I could go back to the old app..Rubbish app that simply doesnt load on my phone- samsung galaxy s6 since upgrade from lg smart air. 40 degree-plus days here in sydney so great time for the app to go bust...NOT.Ok, the server for the app is not working correctly, first experience i coulnt login would freeze did standard trouble shooting got it working but told me network was too slow um running gigabit def not network or internet tested 25Mbs finaly got in app and the app told me could not process request due to server issue. Im hoping you patch this fast or alter the app to become a hydra style app using this at its base but using smaller apps as its heads. going from smart ac to this is not a pleasant experience i now have to use a app that wont even turn on my A/C that i paid $120 for the dongle to be able to use and was working until last week on the smart ac app.Ask for too many permissions, like access to your sms and contacts. Also ask personal information like date of birth. Way too much intrusive..I set up an LG account to register my new washer.  I downloaded an app from the tag on the machine which took me here. This won\\'t let me log onto LG account with my ID and password. Checked and triple checked with no joy.  Sort it please.So LG is Blocking root users,  and claiming there is a compliance law forcing them to.  Show me the law,  LG.    Also,  the most recent version of the app is now requesting location access.  Why the hell do you need GPS access on my phone? I\\'m stuck with the washer and dryer,  but when I remodel the kitchen I\\'m not buying LG..This app is a waste of time.  It refuses to maintain connection with my Note 4.  Each time I set the settings on it to start my oven with TagOn I have to walk to my stove to reconnect.  What a poor substitute for my previous app..New update requests far too many permissions. Uninstalling due to privacy concerns. Why does an appliance app need access to contacts?.Was forced to download, app won\\'t recognize my machine.  Old app was just fine.  Bring back old app!.This is crap I\\'ve tried to diagnose my drier 5 times and it never worked always said it did not get anything. It SUCKS and btw why do yo need to connetct to my Facebook or me G+ account this is too intrusive.Was hoping I could use this app to download a drying cycle to my dryer that wouldn\\'t leave my clothes damp. It registered my washer and dryer fine using NFC, but wouldn\\'t see my phone when I tried to download the new cycle to the dryer. Tried for almost half an hour moving my phone slowly all over the Tag On logo, so I am sure it isn\\'t the NFC location. I wish LG would test their apps thoroughly so I wouldn\\'t have to test out their warranty and return policy..We fail to understand why the app needs so many permissions just to control a washing machine?  Why would LG want to access the camera, microphone, location, contacts and phone?  My mum always said \"Do not wash your dirty linen in public\", so we are avoiding this app now as given all the permissions we need to grant to it we suspect there is a website somewhere where people can actually watch dirty linen being washed, with live feeds direct from LG washing machine owners!  LG say here they don\\'t collect personal information, then why ask for it?  Even if they don\\'t collect it  and it\\'s just down to lazy programmers, it\\'s a security breach waiting for someone to exploit via the app.  No thanks LG..This program does not add any value to my brand new lg washer and dryer..This App makes me want to kill myself. Tried to register my brand new DLEX9000V, but the app says the product is not compatible. I just took the plastic wrap off the machine and it\\'s already broken..Ugh. App sees my router. When I push connect on the appliance, the app turns my phone wifi off and on repeatedly, sometimes connecting to some LG network on the appliance. It just cycles back and forth between these networks and never goes anywhere.Bought new washer FH4U2VCN4 last week, but this app is not working and not showing cycle times as they said, tried to get support from LG, even agent also doesn\\'t know about app. Planning to send it back.Its my fault, that y I ordered LG after changing my mind from Samsung..My washer won\\'t connect to the new app.  I had to re register it and everything and it constantly fails. So I logged into my lg account online and my washer had vanished. Re registered but the app tells me my password is wrong when I try to log in with my lg account. I tried a password reset, but it just resets the password on the app and not my account which means they\\'re not linked up..Doesn\\'t work. I tried connecting my washer and dryer, having NFC turned on, and after uninstalling and reinstalling to no avail. After looking at the reviews, it looks to me as if it\\'s the app\\'s fault and not mine..Absolute rubbish, never buy lg products......have sent company an email. This app no longer  recognises my heatpump since new app. First my ipad a few weeks back but could still use my android now nothing, and they haven\\'t bothered to fix it. Waste of money buying wifi dongle..It can never connect!! I took my phone out of my case and rubbed it all over the stupid logo but IT NEVER CONNECTS!! Useless..I can\\'t start app, just blank whwn i open.Was forced to upgrade to ThinQ. Couldn\\'t download the baby wear cycle as we had with the previous app. We could only download the kids wear cycle which isn\\'t the same....Doesn\\'t work on a rooted phone. Why on earth would you need to block root from a laundry app lol? Come on dev.....Had to install this app to control my A/C.  But the app won\\'t load only shows a blank screen.Recently buyed washing machine( 2 in 1) with dryer model NO-FH4U2TDHP4N,there was 20 washing programms are present in this app it really useful to me,i am downloading and sending that programm to my washing maching through nfc of my phone sony xperia z3 plus,its really useful, i didnt understand why people giving negative reviews but for me this app helping me alot, really a innovative.I prefer the old App!  Much better download cycles...this one is awful..\"Start diagnosis\" fails after 2 seconds, not long enough for washer to make sounds..Dose not work at all can\\'t control my aircon it wont even load up.Please don\\'t download this app.. It\\'s not working properly, looks like just an app with appeance.downloaded this app with forceful notification by LG smart laundry app still both app are not alive, and simply sitting in this play store.The app will not open- it goes to a login screen and when you press login the screen goes blank and stays that way. I have an LG phone, which this is supposed to work better with?.App won\\'t even load. The old app was fantastic. Could turn my air con on whenever I wanted. Now I can\\'t even view it. I can\\'t open the old app either. How do I get it back.Had \"LG Smart AC\", for my aircon/heat unit but was \"forced\" to upgrade - no questions asked. That resulted in 1) Not working due to rooted device ( _MY_ device - and yes, sometimes you have to root your device if hardware is not supported/upgradeable to newer Android versions, so you have to rely on third party developers ) 2) Slow - or more precise - VERY slow 3) No presets - bummer, and a development redo 4) Temperature readings are wrong - notusable 5) NO \"LH\" settings ( ACO is only \"¡¾ 3.6 ¡ÆF (¡¾2¡ÆC), from the temperature set on the Dashboard\" and not below  64 ¡ÆF (18 ¡ÆC) .  Probably some more things, but have no time to play around with that right now - will look for some alternatives to LG and their remote functionality..Do not download it. Worst application. Does not link with account.It just shows a white screen.  Nothing happens.Worst app ever doesnt work at all.So sad. My phone is rooted phone :(.This app is horrible, I liked the other app that used for my washer. I don\\'t how I\\'m forced to use this..Doesn\\'t work on rooted phone..I like it .it works perfectly after the new update.Too many permissions for me. I\\'m out..This app is not working on my phone. Moto X play...Nfc is supported in my device.It\\'s OK. Using it to track washer and dryer timing and completion..Why oh why does this need my location?.Newer better? NO!! I miss my old LG app! Go back!.old app worked perfectly well. new app mandates registration for why ???.Pure bullhorn.Pathetic!!!.Easy app. NF worked fine on Nexus (turn on in settings). Downloaded rinse and spin which is been hunting for. Reading reviews I expected worse but it\\'s great. Even reminds me to clean machine. I would like a steer on where I can find timings / durations for washes as it\\'s not until starting on machine that I see them. And some are 2hrs. I\\'d also like it to be easier to activate speedy turbo wash. I can\\'t see where I can start my machine remotely either? Delay start also seems to be delay end time not start..I am trying to clean my tub on my lg washer and the feature is gone. What the heck happened? The old app worked and gave me the option to clean my tub. I have been reading so many negative reviews but all you guys ask is for our email address to email us I guess, the instructions. Why not just post it on here? Come on now. Why fix something that is not broken? After you guys receive all the negative reviews, why not attempt to fix the app?.The old LG apps is much better and user friendly use. Current apps design was lousy and not user friendly. I had spent like 20minutes to understand the Tub Clean start up from the guide. Previous apps would have the auto kick start tub clean by NFC touch(awesome). Please get the app developer team to enhance this apps..There was only small load for the washer and super dry for the dryer - none of the claimed numerous settings to download by LG. As far as I can tell that\\'s all this app does - no diagnostics at all. It would not recognize my LG account online so I was forced to make a new one. I\\'m definitely not impressed with this app. Not as advertised at all. I recommend some serious updates on LG\\'s part..This app replaced Smart Laundry which was not great but had some nice features.  All of the features were removed from the new app, so it has no useful function that I can find.  Perhaps if washer/dryer fails it may help, but thankfully, I have not had that problem yet..I have the DLEX5000 and WM5000HV but the app wont pair with the washer dryer. I\\'ve followed the installation instructions and everytime the unit shows up on my wifi list suddenly the pair process stops and I get an error message. What\\'s wrong with this app?   NOT A WIFI ENVIRONMENT ISSUE. ERROR MESSAGE APPEARS STATING \"The app does not support this product\". Why wouldn\\'t your app support your top of the line machines?.Does not work with tablets. Too many questionable permissions. Fix it and I\\'ll update my rating. Dropped starts to 1 because I found that now it is impossible to download cycles to washer our dryer, it just fails every time. Paid so much money for their top of the line washer and dryer and get such a lousy software engineering. Unacceptable..Installed this on my phone (Samsung Galaxy Note 4, OS=6.0.1). Connected with my new washer but all I can do is download settings.   None of the features shown in Playstore are there nor do I see the icons depicted at the bottom of the screen (in the playstore screenshots). The washer manual shows how to set up a phone but it\\'s obviously for an LG phone. I\\'m thinking that I set my phone up correctly as it did connect to the washer. Pretty useless to me..Replaced a functional app. The \\'tag on\\' features registered my washer after 15 minutes of sliding my phone around and it refuses to register my dryer so the app and diagnostic features are pretty useless. Ridiculous permissions needed and 60mb for this? Horrible..I linked my oven and now all option look like \"@CP...\" or \"@OV...\" or something like that. I can\\'t tell what the buttons are for without proper names. The app is unusable..while trying to connect fridge with the tag on option. returns an error. alternate connect option thru SmartQ function also dowsnot work.Ive installed this app after the prompt on my old one and it wont even open. The loading symbol swirls around then i get an error advising it couldnt connect to LGs servers.Older Version was amazing, displaying actual error codes, warranty checks, alerting repair uf under warranty, and storing history if diagnostic tests. This App offers only frustrations..Too many permissions are required, ridiculously big app size, slow, oversimplificated yet complicated UI, forced account creation.Won\\'t open in Pixel. Old LG app worked fine. This one won\\'t open at all. Execution error UPDATE: Once I uninstalled the old version of Smart Laundry, this new app works fine..Downloaded the \\'old\\' app as instructed, gave ridiculous permissions only to be FORCED to download the new app that wants  more details to do the advertised features of the previous app stated in the manual... only want a washing machine not a cloud personal data mining service..Everytime I try to run the smart diagnosis for my refrigerator the app crashes before it gets the entire audio from it..Hold my phone against appliances and nothing happens. Do they even test the app before releasing it?.Life\\'s NOT good with this new lg app, the previous lg laundry app were perfect..why change it??? Will not by lg product again..I can\\'t change any settings for my washer. I only have \"small load\" to choose from. Utter crap LG..This app is very good!! I used this app in the past, but the past app was slow. Yet, I used this right now, it become more faster. It is great!!!.Why do I need an account. I already bought your product. Leave me alone, I don\\'t want any online crap!.Useless. I try to log in with my email account, and account is registered for U.S. only?! I can\\'t even access the app to see any features. I\\'ll buy GE next time..It will not even let me log in to the app. When attempted it just goes to a white blank screen..lg  look at the ratings. its not good. i wont install and wont link. screw you guys im done with your stuff if you dont fix this.. we all are..Funguje bez problemu. Hodi se, kdyz potrebuji nahrat novy program na prani. A smart diagnosis jsem na?t?st? jeste nevyuzila. Celkove jsem s aplikaci velmi spokojena..This is junk app...just for collecting people\\'s data for marketing purpose.  DELETE.Just purchased a 30 cubic feet unit....followed instructions for Smart features  to the NTH degree....does not connect nor does it give me any of the options to log in as per the manual....this is ridiculous and a waste of my precious time.....Forced from a perfectly good app to this useless pile of stuff. Why?.Followed directions for smart phone diagnosis and all it says is failed. I still can\\'t adjust the temperature for my refrigerator and freezer. Support site is no help, it also sucks..Hi Lg, I really don\\'t understand how to use this app, please send me the guideline.Compared to the old app this one is extremely slow running on my Nexus 5X.Requires an unreasonable number of permissions..Just bought a new washer and tried using the NFC feature on my ZTE axon 7. Nothing happens. NFC is enabled too..Cook top feature doesn\\'t work.Waste of time nothing works.Won\\'t open on Samsung S7..Wm4370hwa & dlgx4371w with Nexus6p.Love it, can throw in whatever and do laundry whenever.The old app worked so much better..Dashboard doesn\\'t show wash cycle as shown.Just wont work.Crashed on set up.Doesn\\'t work.User friendly app. Saved me so much time by using this app! Love it..Very good and easy to use..I had no problem switching to this app from LG Smart Laundry.  Both machines reregistered with little effort, and the usage data transferred without a problem.  The UI is significantly different, and some features might be hidden or missing altogether, but it\\'s clear that this app is going to be for much more than just laundry.  -1 star for requiring WAY too many permissions..Not only it needs all the permissions, but i see no any real functionality here.  By the way, I just realized this application takes 174 mb once installed. It is unreal how poorly designed this thing is. It really says much about LG as a brand and how they promote themselves as Smart. What a joke!.I sell appliances, including LG, and it\\'s pretty infuriating that I can\\'t show off NFC to my customers. I also find it funny that the person responding to these comments about this app just copies and pastes his replies. A lot of these people leaving reviews are not \"sirs\". Miss idiot LG technician..Not that Smart Laundry was a great app, it at least got the job done. The supersedes Smart Laundry, but it doesn\\'t even inherit registered appliances. Also this won\\'t read important status messages from the appliances like when to run a cleaning cycle or whether dryer exhaust flow is nominal. Really, really bad app. Shameful!.This app is useless. It takes me to a screen that says Simple Login or LG Account Login and no matter which option I choose it just takes me to a blank white screen and goes nowhere.  Both my washer and dryer have the NFC logo but neither will connect to this app or the older LG Smart Laundry app..I registered my refrigerator and it just sits at the dashboard with a loading spinner forever. I can\\'t do anything at all.  I\\'ve force killed the app and tried 3 times. It simply will not let me do anything.  Trying to diagnose the same a problem I\\'ve already had \"fixed\" by LG with my $3000 refrigerator that is now barely out of warranty. I am so done with LG..Why do I need to register an account? Especially to use an inferior app! The smart laundry app was brilliant, gave me loads of info about my machine and was easy to use. The new app doesn\\'t even tell me how many times I\\'ve used the machine since I last cleaned it! And LG have killed the old laundry app so I can\\'t even go back to it! Awful! Awful! Awful! I wish I could give zero stars!.For WHAT reason is this necessary? Too many permissions, installation of another 60mb of cr** required even if I have fully functioning LG Smart Laundry? This is good for nothing else than spying LG customers!.The list of permissions required was longer than the screen. Must sign in and give LG your email and personal information.   This is an appliance. I don\\'t want to friend you. I don\\'t want extra marketing crap. Let me check the health of my appliance and go away. I hope whatever executive thought this was a good idea gets fired..I was hoping for the best but was expecting the worst, and the worst is what I got. Like everyone else, they pulled the app that worked and force people onto this one. In fairness I get why they want one app to rule them all but at the very least it should work. I tried to register my washer, wm5000hva, it returns saying this washing machine isn\\'t supported even though it worked with the old app.... And the dryer, it doesn\\'t even try (dlex5000). LG, you should be ashamed to have your name on this app..Your manuals still reference Smart Laundry and yet as all have stated all this app does is allow one to download a new cycle if available.  So virtually useless and practically no need for it, plus makes absolutely no sense to refuse to actually have non canned answers to these concerns. You do not even refer to the user\\'s name in the canned answer of you\\'re supporting the issue, whatever that means? #FAIL.Used LG Smart Laundry until forced to upgrade.  Smart Laundry worked perfectly!  This new ap is not user friendly, and is missing downloadable cycles for the washer that were available in Smart Laundry (cycles that were regularly used).  No sign in was required with Smart Laundry, now I am forced to sign in to an account in order to change cycles or check machine status.  Dislike this new ap immensely, and wish I had the choice to use the original ap!.I simply wanted to see if it was time for my tub clean. I can\\'t get that. You have forgotten which products I have. I need to register again, with an app that wants too many permissions. I thought the odor from the washing machine was bad, but it doesn\\'t stink nearly as much as this app!!!  &gt; we are trying to improve the inconvenience  Well you are succeeding at adding to it..Previous Smart Laundry app worked fine, but this app doesn\\'t even work when registering the appliance. I\\'m using a front loading washer and dryer with NFC tag on. Since the previous app stopped functioning, I no longer have the ability to use the diagnostic feature..Superb customer support and follow up, they want the app to work. Have revised my feedback due to the issue being linked to my phone does not have NFC. When I tap Yes for prod w Tag On function I get an error message in the app and unable to register the prod, thus making this app useless for me at the moment.So excited to use this with my new washer and dryer.  It\\'s part of the reason I chose the ones I did.  I get the start up screen, press log on and it goes to a white screen. Nothing else. Nothing. Since the app doesn\\'t work, that means a feature of my appliances doesn\\'t work.  Rip. Off..This app does nothing. Please fix it. I have one of your dryers and app is useless. Please hire some competent software engineers and software project managers. Stop feeling sorry for inconveniences(your response to other) just fix it..This new app is not user friendly. The old app had all the different functions that I could pick and tap on to start the load. I also don\\'t see a way to check when it needs to be cleaned. This new app is ridiculous, bring back the old one..There\\'s no reason for all these permissions and I don\\'t want to have to create yet another account just to be able to do a load of laundry. And protip: if you\\'re going to try to use SSO, for the love of all that\\'s holy, don\\'t stick it in a webview. Ugh..Broken app does not function with my refridgerator, I paid A lot of money for promised smart functionality using my android. Want an immediate fix, no excuses, and whoever is responding if paste the same response again it will prove your complete lack of common sense, and intelligence. All i get after 20 attempts is \"product registration failure\".Doesnt let me download any dryer options at all. It says download fail after going up to 60% and then says check if you are close enough. When i am directly touching the machine. Can u please fix this i bought this dryer specially for this app function. Im on the go a lot and need my clothes dry!.Could not login with previous laundry app login. Says not available in the USA. I am in Canada. Had to use my Facebook login which works but that\\'s ridiculous. Also a couple of download cycles have been dropped from the previous app. Not overly happy. A new app should be better not worse..The app is working fine for me, but there is not a hand wash cycle. My last LG washer had this cycle, so I was bummed when this one did not. I am surprised and disappointed this wasn\\'t on the list to download..I was able to download the app and register but I can like see what cycle my washer is on our time or any of that stuff I\\'m only able to do a tub clean or self-diagnosis I don\\'t have any other options on washer status.The main reason I bought these washer and dryer units was for the extended features added by the app but what good is it if the damn app won\\'t sync to either unit. I have tried everything!.Well done dingbats! Made me download this app as my LG Smart Laundry app tells me to. Can\\'t log in using my LG account details as details are incorrect (funny as they work via their website), so now can\\'t use this app OR the previous one. Makes the NFC part of my washing machine(a big selling point) OBSOLETE. Shocking app from a massive multinational. That almost never happens ??.No functionality compared to Smart Laundry.  Can\\'t see any machine statistics like used to be able too.  One download able cycle? Used to be loads.  LG bring back smart laundry!.Forced to upgrade app unable to use old one that worked brilliantly, functions of old app no longer there. LG laundry app worked fine. Used  to be able to tag on to find when to do tub clean and turn on via phone, not any more. Registered device new app nfc how dumb, does not know model of washer? Default name washer can\\'t change to longer name? I\\'m all for progress, but this is not it. Let me roll back to old app until this one is actually completely ready for release with all the functions..Please go back to old app this one will not let me register my washer and dryer set. I used to be able to just pick a setting & Tap my phone to the appliance & it\\'d start right up. This app is not even worth a star!.I had a problem registering my LG account. This is because you need to set up a separate account for the app which wasn\\'t apparent. I\\'ve knocked a star off as I don\\'t feel the app is very intuitive plus I don\\'t understand why it needs so many permissions. However, it works well and I\\'m able to download new wash cycles for my washer dryer as well as use it as a diagnostic tool..My number one complaint is the custom Notification box they force on top of other applications.  In what rational world is a load of clothes finishing so critical that it demands exclusive, immediate attention and action? LG, please leverage your synergy and implement normal notifications.  The state of my laundry does not need an obtrusive eyesore that demands interaction. Also, every user input in the application seems to result in a slow, half hearted reaction..Old app let you check on wash progress. Only thing this app seems to do is diagnosis of the machine.  Can\\'t use old app anymore since when you open it you get told to use the new app..The old Smart Laundry app was phenomenal! It had tons of load choices and an easy interface. This one? This \"update\" has one.. yes ONE cycle! Are you kidding me? Give me my old app back!.The new app doesn\\'t let me check to see when I need to clean the washer. Why would you take this away??  This was what I liked the most.  Why punish those who don\\'t have the absolute latest washing machine (purchased mine December 2015)  Also don\\'t like having to create an account..I have a new dual washer model along with the matching dryer, and they are not cheap... yet it didn\\'t connect with the older app, and still doesn\\'t work with this new app. Horrible.Forced to update from.  LG SMART LAUNDRY. This app does not support my brand new washer. Now I don\\'t have any app that works with my washer. Give me back Smart Laundry, not the best app but atleast it worked!.I can\\'t even get this app to sync to my dryer with the NFC tag.  I use Android Pay and other NFC apps all the time so I know it\\'s not a problem with my phone. Completely useless..Dies every time I try to run diagnosis, tried reinstall same thing happened. Absolutely pathetic. Would give minus stars if I could..The smart laundry app was great, loads of different choices for cycles and downloadable ones, thought it was great, this one has to be the most unfriendly user app ever, don\\'t really see the point of having it as I can\\'t even find a saving wash as before.The old version was much better more programmes to down load. This one hasn\\'t even got a quick wash. Waste of time. Bring aback the old one..LG replaced a 37 MB Smart Laundry app with this 175 MB pig that doesn\\'t even understand the cycles I\\'ve already downloaded into my washer and dryer.  My phone tells me the app is 101 MB and after running the app and connecting it to my washer and dryer, it is using 73.46 MB of data for a total of 175 MB, regardless of what LG claims.  The old app shows as 37.15 MB with only 40 KB of data, for a total of 37.19 MB..I had low expectations and LG managed to even miss this. NFC to register the appliance to your phone works so poorly that it took me 30 mins just to pair. Then once paired, the only feature for my newly purchased 2016 washer and dryer is to download cryptic new cycles that don\\'t appear to change the appliance settings much. The features are so abysmal it\\'s a joke and an insult to consumers..What an actual pain in the a**. The LG app worked fine, this is totally pointless and doesn\\'t work at all. ?? Diagnostics doesn\\'t work now and where the hell is the Quick Wash. As if I\\'ve not had enough bother with this machine....now this. ??????????.It can only tag on my washer and not my dryer even though they are a set, it has almost no washer functionality, except to download a few cycles, fewer than the old app, and won\\'t tell you when the washer is due for the tub cleaning cycle. How is this an upgrade?.The old app worked fine, but now it no longer functions so you\\'re forced to use this one.  Most of the useful features have been inexplicably removed, and the UI is worse..Much preferred the smart laundry app,  thin q doesn\\'t allow me to download wash cycles and all the messages displayed in the app look like xml coding with @ symbols everywhere.Much preferred it\\'s predecessor, lost half the functionality on my washing machine compared to the earlier version. Go back to LG Smart Laundry. Why isn\\'t there a cycle for washing waterproofs available to download?.Imagine an LG engineer had run into your kitchen & removed the control nob from your washing machine... you would be quite angry I imagine. That is exactly how I feel because I spent loads of money on an LG washing machine with \\'tag on\\' that allowed me to control it & select appropriate cycles from my phone and now they have destroyed the app that allowed me to do that and replaced it with this entirely useless one. If you could give 0 stars that is what this would get. No more LG products for this house :(.What a load of rubbish this app is surely with all these negative comments you should be able to go back to using the original app I used to love using my NFC but can\\'t use it too much fiddling around easier just to read the manual. Wasn\\'t notified about a tub clean tried to use the tag on to download it to the washing machine wouldn\\'t let me. Sort it out LG. I have been recommending your washing machine but only cause you can use a mobile app but won\\'t bother anymore!!.I should have simply read the past reviews and not bothered to install this app. Disappointed....This app does not recognize either of my new washer and dryer models. LG support did not help. They only provided a weblink  to their support page. None of the support info fixes the issues..Not as many wash options as the original app. Extremely frustrating! I have a smart washer and dryer but not such a smart-app!!.This can\\'t won\\'t allow me to clean the tub. It gives me the option but won\\'t actually allow me to do so. Had no problems with the other app, sucks. Not a very nice app..Tried multiple times to register WM5000HVA washer.  App initially displays product is registered, then tries to establish a connection.  Returns product registration failed..Does not recognise my LG account log in even though I can log in on the website. I refuse to allow LG to use my Google or FB accounts just to check a fault code on my washing machine. What is the point of this app ?.Being forced to use this \"upgrade\" when the original worked great & looked great. This one looks terrible! Stop moving everything around!.Bring back LG laundry. Does not recognise my LG account, difficult to use and I can\\'t find the further quick use cycles... Such as steam refresh. Just is an excuse to data mine my account information!.Fails when attempt to login that not supported in USA. But i am in Canada. Can\\'t use this new one and the old one that worked fine just directs to this crap..After seeing the bad reviews I was concerned with the update. I luckily had no issues registering or getting the cycles to work with the tag on feature on my Galaxy S6 phone. My only complaint is I am still waiting to see if a STEAM ONLY cycle can be added to the options of cycles. I had to have my last LG washer replaced because it could not be fixed. On my previous model I had a steam fresh only cycle that I used constantly for wrinkle removal. New washer has steam feature for wash cycles only..App doesn\\'t work at all. Unable to register my washer, dryer or refrigerator.  Was able to with the old app..Was diverted to this app after installing the app from the lg website and wont recognise my dishwasher. Also requires too much personal info to just check what the error is..This app doesn\\'t work with a brand new lg nfc washer. Says the washer doesn\\'t exist. Ended up installing old app apk version 2.30.5 from apkpure.This new app is terrible.  The biggest problem I have with my brand new washer is that the app does not recognize that I have remote start selected on my washer I can no longer  control  my smart washer that I just bought with my  smartphone.I really tried to get this going but it doesn\\'t work for the iPhone and my android phone the app is no good dissatisfied..Lg smart laundry was much better.  No description of what cycles do, no laundry guide.  Says not available in USA but I\\'m in Canada. Total garbage.Aside from the (ridiculous) registration requirement, this app doesn\\'t have the cycles for my washer that the previous app did!.Update: After contacting support and an update of Android Web View it now works.         I constantly get a white screen on startup, after clicking the pink start button..LG Smart Laundry was a lot better than this garbage. I\\'m sorry to see the lack of imagination and design thinking..Was forced to install by laundry app. An impressive amount of required permissions... That were not needed, since the app failed to start..Can\\'t register my washing machine because if it does find it after 20mins of trying it gets to 30% and stops saying its an error. I think tried to use my machine and it wouldn\\'t let me select what program I wanted. Had to totally reset the machine. Don\\'t waist your time!.Dryer no longer supported. Washer manual hard to use in app..My phone beings to sync with machine and it goes to 30% or 80% then gives me an error? I did this for 20 mins straight. The communication is there, but the app stops it. Android-Samsung 7.I can\\'t get the app to show me how many hours or minutes I have left on my washing machine. How do you get it to show up in the app.Can\\'t even register my washer dryer. Display error code.  Mr Technician, don\\'t reply to this. Just spend time fixing this poor App!.I get this error: \"Failed Execution\" and the app won\\'t even open. Glad this wasn\\'t a huge selling point on my new washer and dryer..Forced to upgrade to lg smart thinQ, now my lg F1612dbge not supported by this apps..Fails to initialize. On a LG phone too. I need to find out whats wrong with my range..Waste of time.  Doesn\\'t have any options. Ex: load size option: small..and that\\'s it.  Took forever to connect.  LG not smart.Thanks to the help of the programmers I can now use the app with my washing machine, now I would have to wait to get more programming options for my machine..Version 1.6 runs fine on my phone but anything after that crashes on Startup can\\'t use these have to take full control of my LG washer and dryer nothing but waste of time can\\'t even open the app without it telling me to update once update is done Apple never open again until consistently keeps crashing useless application and useless development team.Advertising a function which does not work is surely against the advertising standard..Worked with HTC One,  but with HTC 10 app won\\'t read NFC tag..I tried to register my appliance via NFC. It totally doesn\\'t work..The app really doesn\\'t do anything. No useful information...Boo!.They want access to everything. .what control freak..Can\\'t register washer or dryer.Working with my new WD1014RW!!! The app is a little lazy but do the work....I think this app is more useful in the American market then the Australian market, cause thats where they all talk crap, like this app, and no i will not be responding back to LG..This is terrible!!!.It wouldn\\'t even allow me to log in.We just got the WM9000 on sale and have had no trouble using this app to get everything set up, trigger remote start, and get alerts..No helpful functional, no setting, no downloadable cycle for washer....Can\\'t get the downloaded cycles I had before. What good is this?.Doesn\\'t even work..who designed this and even more who approved it\\'s distribution .....Can\\'t connect to my washing machine.cant register my washer top load.Stays on loading screen. Useless app.Great waste of space on my phone.Works as expected with my new washer and dryer.  Love it..Did not work at work but the team here helped me out and now works as advertised.Not such a smart thing.Great app to download Extra cycles and use on the lg washing machine. Good work LG.i try to tag my fridge it keep on ask me to verify my account.very good app . but lm ldont use in the app.Does not work right.Use my HOM-BOT plus with this  application. Everything is working well. Immediate response from support team..Wont even let me connect to my dryer.WON\\'T OPEN!!!!!!.Bring back the old app.¬¯¬Ö ¬â¬Ñ¬Ò¬à¬ä¬Ñ¬Ö¬ä ¬Ó¬ã¬à¬Ó¬ã¬Ö¬Þ.Sucked.not working at all.works fantastic with new washing machine and samsung galaxy s7 edge.Works as Described.Outstanding app but from what I understand it does not automatically work with all LG appliances so check your model to see if it has Smart Thinq capabilities. When used with the top of line Riboking vacuum it is AWESOME! Monitors my house while I am away and lets me know if any motions is detected, allows to schedule vacumm start / stop times, allows me to see how much of my apartmebt roboking still has to vacuum... Adds so much functionality to my littlw robot vacuum... Its great!!.The old LG Fridge app was working just fine. I can\\'t get this all encompasing comprehensive app to connect to my 3 month old fridge. Terrible app. I should be able to use the old app, but no, I\\'m forced to use this one or nothing. Looks like nothing is going to win..This thing took me an hour to get the washer registered. After 2 hours I gave up on the dryer. Very poorly designed..It works with my new washer and dryer, but has no useful features. What\\'s the point?.A new app that does less that the old one...hmmmm! I cant load my pics to the fridge through the app anymore....I tried around 20 times and it kept saying, \"failed\". What a waste of time.My washer is compatible with the app but it is completely useless.  What Is the point of this app?.I just installed it bc I thought it\\'s awesome that I can check my fridge temp that way. I just got my door in door yesterday and I have a feeling the fridge doesn\\'t get below 8-10 degree Celsius.  I have it set to 1 degree now and before around 3. after 30 hrs running it should be cold. the freezer is. what I don\\'t get why the pics above show that temperature control and such and I only can do is a service check. kinda sucks. so app is kinda useless unless u have a problem.I can not rate something 2-5 mins.after installing it. I actually need to use it first. So ask me again in a couple days, I should have a rating in mind by then. Thanks for taking time to read this I hope, (Google)??.It \"works\" on galaxy s6, but the only thing you can do is save some settings?  What is the point?!?.It\\'s decent but doesn\\'t display an option on the application to change from Fahrenheit to Celsius..Fantastic features.Two months ago I downloaded the old app, which did Smart Diagnosis and worked great. The phone was rebooted in the meantime, and I was so sorry to find this new app. Really, to do ANYTHING I have give you my email and set up a password? No thanks! Bring back the one that worked..I own an LG washer and dryer. I used the \"Tag On\" and it says they are not supported. Old application forces you to use this one. Not even 1 year and the features of my washer and dryer are now useless. I should be able to download my cycles and cannot. Thanks LG for forcing us to use unsupported software..I don\\'t understand this app at all. I can register my washer and dryer, and thats pretty much it. I have to try several times to download a cycle (to which no description is given), though it does load properly when tagging it to the appliance. Also, why does the app need access to my phone, contacts, and location? Shouldn\\'t  it pick up the WiFi? Please make this more user friendly!.Terrible !!!! As alot of people are saying all the permissions required are \\na joke and you can\\'t open it without them. All I want is the old smart \\ndiagnosis app not some loaded up peice of junk that I have to either create \\na new account for or give access to a social media accout and then give \\nbasically full access to my phone.The app handles the request for security permissions poorly, rather than \\ndisabling just the portions of the app for the denied permissions it just \\naborts itself. No you can not have permissions to identify my device that \\nyou claim that will only be used if I call customer service, wait until I \\nuse that feature THEN re-request the permission..I think this app is too intrusive!! In the terms of agreement your app \\nisn\\'t just making sure there\\'s enough space, it states that my pics, files, \\netc are able to be used or shared as your company sees fit. What a waste of \\nan app. I just bought my new washer and dryer and was excited for the extra \\nfeatures... But at the sake of my privacy being violated... NO THANK YOU!!.Why do you need an LG ACCOUNT to use an appliance.Why do you need an email \\nor Facebook account to use a washer dryer or any other Appliance. This is \\noutrageous. Spend thousands of dollars on a new Appliance and be told how \\ngreat and easy it is to use and troubleshoot issues. But only if you allow \\nLG access to your location, media files (pictures) and other private \\ninformation. Outrageous! Update: my wife downloaded the app and accepted \\nthe permissions and it WILL NOT WORK on her Samsung phone. LG responded to \\nmy first review explaining that the permissions are needed to be sure the \\napp is working properly. Completely missing the point that an app that \\nconnects to a simple house hold appliance dose not needed access to all \\nthis personal information. I will be returning my new washer and dryer and \\nLG CAN GO F*** OFF!.Won\\'t work on rooted devices, although my device has to be rooted in order \\nto function properly in Europe. It\\'s a shame every single banking app out \\nthere has compliance and security strategies for rooted devices but the \\nf\\'ing LG application for my washer can\\'t work. Who the hell is in charge at \\nLG\\'s development department for an official app having 2.7 stars and major \\nissues, my boss would fire me if I do such bad work. Seems the customer is \\nirrelevant for LG..Why the F**** does a washing machine app need my location, access to my \\nphone book, My birthday just so I can use a dang jeans setting on my new \\nwasher and dryer. Privacy Act of 1974 protects my rights to privacy. This \\napp should be removed from google play until they fix this issue..The old app worked perfectly. Now the old app does not work. It would keep track of how many cycles it ran before it needed cleaned. The new app won\\'t even let me run a cleaning cycle. Worse yet, the old app\\'s functionality was intentionally shut off. When you open the old app, it sends you to this one which does not work..An exercise in frustration from start to finish! Pairing a device might \\nwork once if you are lucky but most times it will just sit there \\nindefinatey. App requests tons of permissions (camera, contacts, etc.) \\nHonestly I think this is a dataminer disguised as a convenience tool..What horrible junk. Trying to link this app with my front load washer and \\ndryer but no luck. It asks me to hold my phone to the logo on the appliance \\nfor nfc connection. Nothing happens. It\\'s like my appliance has the label \\nbut no nfc is available or turned on. How do I get my appliances loaded \\ninto this app?.App just won\\'t NFC connect to washer.  I have a Galaxy S7 with Android up to date.  I can transfer files to anothrr phone via NFC and can use Amdroid pay at merchants  so I know the technology works.  I have no clue as to what to do and LG phone support hasn\\'t been of any help at all.  I quit.  Uninstall..If I could have given it 0 stars I would have.  This app is completely useless.  The previous one was much better.  I liked the other one and used it regularly but this new one,  I deleted.  Why mess with something that was working so well and user friendly to force everyone into this garbage update..Screw you LG I can\\'t believe this app is a thing if I have to go tap the oven to start it why not just use the controls there. LG smart oven worked so much better. Think q better blow yourself . Too bad your oleds are amazing or id never buy LG again.I can\\'t believe that for several months corporation like LG can\\'t make \\ninternational smart assistant coverage for its IoT line! Ridiculous! \\nProbably last time I mistaken to buy your products, based on false future \\ndevelopment promises!.Requires way too many permissions. Storage, location and wants to MAKE \\nphone calls without my say so.Then registration and login. Intrusive as \\nhell. A bit too much just to operate a bloody washing machine... \\nUninstalled immediately..Like others, I found the found the amount of permissions to be ridiculous. \\nDo you want my social security number and bank account logins also? Can\\'t \\nreally say anything about the app performance, since I didn\\'t run it..The app is a hilariously ridiculous. It requires a lot of permissions right \\nfrom the start, then asks you to register! The reason why Google have added \\nruntime permissions is to ensure the app asks for them when needed, not \\nwhen developer wants it. Crazy how such company as LG can have this kind of \\napp..It would find my WiFi but would only once go further. Also, since I don\\'t have a door in door it doesn\\'t tell me how to make my refrigerator visible.  I had such high hopes!.App doesn\\'t work with HTC 10. I used my phone to Android Beam photos to and from phone using NFC so the phone isn\\'t the issue. App won\\'t register washer or dryer so it is either the app, washer or dryer Tag On that has the problem.  Hubby was not pleased when he found out we couldn\\'t use app..Too many permissions. States \"to get the most out of ... needs access to\". \\nApparently should say \"to even open the app, needs access to\". Don\\'t \\nunderstand why it should fail to even start up if I deny access to manage \\ncalls or access to location or storage. Give me an error when that \\npermission is actually necessary and fails. Uninstalled, annoyed I can\\'t \\neven see the advanced smart integration advertised for my appliances..Mandatory upgrade breaks app on rooted phones.  Bought an LG laundry pair last fall and an LG tablet recently.  Not planning on buying any more LG appliances or devices if they put arbitarty blocks on them.  What is this, an appliance monitor app or banking app?.There is no situation where any app needs this many permissions to install.  Change it to ask as you choose to use features, or remove unnecessary permission.  I see no reason to share my contacts to manage my appliances..New update is horrible! I don\\'t want to have to create an account just to program my washing machine. The old app didn\\'t require that. You don\\'t need my location, my files or to make phone calls to communicate with my washer. I uninstalled the app and will probably never use it again. You need to come up with a light version that just let\\'s you customize the washer settings..Don\\'t know why you changed from the lg smart laundry app. What an absolute load of rubbish use to be able to tap phone on and it started straight away rubbish for the tub clean too. Not worth the one star.Forced to upgrade from old laundry app. That one was only useful to tell me how many cycles it\\'d been since the last tub clean. This one doesn\\'t even do that. So they went from nearly useless to totally useless. Good job LG..The previous version had all kinds of neat hints, how to read labels, etc....now it does not let you do that. Nor does it let you use the old app, forcing you to upgrade. LG ... life NOT good..I am so disappointed with LG. They took away the great tool their clients had with something very confusing which doesn\\'t even work and requires an unnecessary registration. I can\\'t even use a simple diagnosis system for the washing machine that almost caught fire. Well done for losing yet another client! Brilliant!.The thing is about this app. It connects to my washer and dryer, but doesn\\'t actually work. Maybe the people you pay money to work on this app, could actually fix it. So I can use this wretched app..Not only does it demand all out access... I have to connect my google or fb-account... I just want to use my effing washing machine..Intrusive. Wants access to control my phone, photos, etc. All I want is control of my washing machine. LG also disabled the older Smart Laundry app which worked well for me, forcing the update to this app. Not a chance. Very disappointing..Useless app unless you get the stuff that actually connects with wifi. \\nWeird permissions, just let me tell you what you need to know with my info. \\nBeware, IoT devices are still in their infancy and should be regarded as a \\npotential major security vulnerability. -take it from a systems engineer..Bought a new LG dishwasher. Installed the app and it won\\'t even open. Get a \\nflash of something when I try and open it, but it closes immediately. Tried \\nuninstalling and reinstalling. Still doesn\\'t work. This is on my Samsung \\nGalaxy S6. Update 4/16/18 - Tried it again thinking they might have updated \\nand fixed the problem. Nope. Still won\\'t load, but now I get a message \\nsaying it doesn\\'t work with rooted phones. Lame..App uses highly misleading language about permissions -- and refuses to run \\nwithout broad permissions. LG should build an app that operates properly \\n(even if the capabilities are reduced) when special permissions are denied..Useless. I cannot setup a program in it, just get one of predefined ones. But i can do it using a machine itself! Why do I have to stand near it with a telephone?! I just hoped that this app will give me more control then the stupid machine displey. It gave me nothing at all. Nice..Don\\'t waste your time with this app it does not work at all . It is a shame that LG paid somebody to develop this app , they got took. All it manages to do is frustrate the people who bought LG products. I hope a quality control is better on the product than the app..Downloaded the app on two different phones, run diagnostics and test fails every time.  Seen the rest of the reviews as well...maybe you should test an app to make sure its working well bstore eliminating the prior app that worked fine..All I want to do is wash my clothes. The old app let me do just that. This one wants me to log in, use a password and turn over my life story. It\\'s a washing machine not a nuclear missile launcher. And the stupid app doesn\\'t work..Absolutely not working. I am unable to register my brand new  aircon unit. All i am getting is an error telling me that my device is different from what is already installed. I have none..Another \"Register with a username & password\" crappy app so they can email you spam. I\\'ll pass and use my washing machine the old fashioned way..Want to blackmail me to demand location? Forget it. I just don\\'t use the \\napp any more and forget abt me buying another lg item..It was easy to install and open, and quickly register my oven using the \"tag on\" function with NFC. The app itself loads quickly and navigates smoothly and without issues. However, it immediately seems useless after that. When attempting to operate the oven from the app, it requires that you \"tag on\" and hit \"start\" on the oven itself every time you want to use it. If I have to be at the oven every time I want to use the app, what is the point of the app? I have used other apps like this to manage devices in my home, and the entire point is the convenience of not having to be directly in front of the device.  But if the pointlessness of the app wasn\\'t bad enough, it really disappoints with the fact that it only worked the very first time. And every attempt after the successful first attempt resulted in an error where the app claimed that the knob was not in the \"tag on\" position, although it was..Good luck getting suckers to allow basically everything on their device to be used at your disposal LG.Why can\\'t we have the old app for our washing machines that apparently did work?!!!  This app downloads to your device then NEVER LOADS.  If you can get it to load (I could not) other comments on here I do not doubt.  I do not need an app for a house full of products as I only have an LG washing machine!  PLEASE GIVE US BACK THE OLD WASHING MACHINE APP SO MY MACHINE DOES WHAT I PURCHASED IT FOR, DIAGNOSTICS AND OPTIONS FOR CYCLES.  WHY IS THE OLD APP GONE?  LG PLEASE ANSWER ME AND SO MANY OTHERS!.Bought new washer Sept 2016 from lying salesman at Currys. Told had 5yr guarantee. After  registering it was told it was only 2yrs. Tried downloading smart laundry app but was forced onto smart thinq. LG then want permissions to data mine all my personal info whilst providing an app that doesn\\'t work. Decline all requests and uninstall this piece of rubbish, I have. LG never again.You should not advertise this as a feature for your products if it won\\'t \\neven work. Probably going to take the washer back now just because I feel \\nduped..Why do I have to turning on remote start everytime i use the washer or dryer.  Should just stay on.  Also this should work with ifttt.  I added the lg washer and dryer on ifttt but it says no option.  Looks like LG decided to disable ifttt for last year\\'s models to encourage the new models..Downloaded the app and attempted to login. Emphasis on \"attempted\" because I still haven\\'t been able to login. Tried chatting online with my computer with somebody who did not have a single clue. They were talking about a totally different issue that I wasn\\'t even on the same planet. Total fail LG!.Why does an app for my washing machine need access to my location, calls and file storage? I\\'m not prepared to grant them so here\\'s another one star review..I have a washer/dryer that both have the \"tag on\" function and when I went to use the nfc function on the washer, it redirected me to a google play link that didnt work. Come to find out, the lg smart washer and dw app that is supposed to download when you connect it with nfc isn\\'t available in my country (the us). Now it wants me to install the lg thinq app that my washer/dryer doesn\\'t support. Why does this exist?!.Older model unit. Doesn\\'t connect to new software. Spent too much time \\nreregistering and reregistering the thing. AC doesnt cool. Tried the \\ndiagnositucs app but same result dumb app.what the heck... they said they dont collect information. then why they TOO MANY QUESTIONS. WHY.. THESE APP REALLY SUCKS. consistently they reply to the complaint but they dont do much.. LG.. DONT YOU GET IT.. TOO WAY INTRUSIVE. Cant you see all reviews.. too many permissions. too intrusive.. these was just a simple app why ask for more.Seriously, you want to know my location, phone contacts and access to my phone photos and media.. Is this a diagnostic tool or social engineering? :).Way too many permissions!  Why does it needs access to my personal pictures! Why does ti need to make phone calls! It sounds like a trojan! This is a data mining pos!.The app is a gigantic space hog for what it does.  It also takes 10x as long as it should to start up.  The downloadable cycles for my washing machine and dryer seem to just set the spin speed, wash temp, and mode dial to different presets. I can literally do that before the app has finished loading.  This app is basically a how-to manual for making a slow, ugly, unintuitive Android application. Two stars because it connects and functions as intended, I guess. It\\'s just the intentions don\\'t seem to be the right ones..Forced to upgrade to this app, but this app will not run on a routed device \\nso it is useless to me. Why would the developers care if you have a routed \\nmobile phone or not! Bad programming!.This should just be a simple local app to notify me if my laundry is done. Or maybe some presets for washing and drying clothes. But I will never know.  Too obtrusive with permissions to access calling, location, date of birth, storage access, etc. This is before even opening to test if my washer and dryer would actually sync. Given the reviews, I have my doubts.   Read the privacy statement guys. Seems LG made this app just to generate revenue from selling data mined from your use and information..I fail to understand why my so much personal information is required to \\nactivate this app. More than needed to register my LG appliances. I deleted \\nthe app so I cannot comment on it\\'s functionality. Bottom line, I don\\'t \\ntrust LG with my personal information. RESPONSE: Thank you for your reply. \\nI understand phone permissions needed for your app to function. My \\nobjection is to being required to give LG my birthday - that\\'s way to \\nintrusive for me, and many others, I expect..This app should not need access to everything on my phone to tell me how much longer my laundry has to go. Photos, contacts, my SD card?  This is a joke..Now my washing machine is been lock. I don\\'t ever can use the smart diagnosis.  Pls advise!.The air conditioner I bought is great. 18k btu Dual Inverter. Very quiet. \\nThis app is horrible. Would not connect after many, many attempts. Lists AC \\nas powered off. De-installed..I\\'m very tech savvy and not only followed all of LGs instruction but troubleshooted all over the web, LGs website, and the comments in these review. Couldn\\'t get my new fridge to connect, and to the LG rep who is copying and posting generic responses to people\\'s elaborate questions. Go to hell! You don\\'t deserve a job..This app needs to link automatically and seamlessly to other related \\nsoftware (MyLG account, MyLG app, SmartTV, GoogleAssistant, Alexa, etc). \\nCreating those links is cumbersome if not impossible. Plus it\\'s a huge app. \\nCurrently it\\'s not worth keeping..Asking for crazy permissions... Why do you need to access my media a d be \\nable to make phone calls? I tried anyway and it kept telling me I did not \\nmeet age minimum. I\\'m a grown ass man! Dump the app!.I paid a lot of money for my \"smart\" washer, but LG\\'s app doesn\\'t comprehensively do what LG advertised it would. Get it together, LG, or stop telling customers your appliances and apps can do things they can\\'t reliably do yet. How is it that a company as big as LG can have a current app with so many bad reviews and little resolution in the responses? All these customers who paid hundreds or thousands of dollars for what LG advertised as \"smart\" appliances, and LG just isn\\'t providing them with the functionality they bought and paid for..LG ThinQ doesn\\'t work. Registered multiple times to integrate with Google \\nHome and it never was able to link up despite saying it was linked. Finally \\njust slapped a Chromecast Ultra on it to make it work..Smart diagnosis just doesn\\'t work. It either fails, or says it can\\'t determine the problem with my drier..Just read the privacy policy all the way through; by using the app, you consent to YOUR data being shared with anyone, \"without limitation\", including nations without data protection laws. You also agree to them collecting and sharing information from your mobile or tablet, including pictures, voice, email and contact info. LG are having a laugh. Steer well clear..The company invests in fancy tools but treats clients bad. I was waiting for few months for LG Polska to look into problem with the washing machine and few more to repair it. Imagine the cost with a 2 year old on the board ! Not even a sorry from Lg Polska. Lame.It respond slow. It disconnect unexpectedly. After app reinstall, it cannot pairing again.  If it is stable, slow response is acceptable as a trade-off for remote control over internet, but it don\\'t..Won\\'t even open. Throws some -1000 error. Too bad. Nice idea, but the app won\\'t even load. 100k downloads, and 100k uninstalls.I am not going to allow this app to make phone calls so I uninstalled it. \\nSecurity is important to users but not apparently to LG. Do you really \\nexpect me to open my phone up to a possible hack to make premium rate phone \\ncalls?.App recognized dryer but could never connect to it or diagnosis because app said it couldn\\'t connect to internet. WiFi is working perfect as I am watching Netflix right now. Horrible app!!!.Was forced to install this app. Then wouldn\\'t work unless I gave it permission to make calls etc. Then told me the country was wrong so I had to make a new account but wouldn\\'t let me make a new account since my email is already in use! Not at all impressed with it LG. Needless to say I deleted the app!.Absolutely worthless app. My LG washer and dryer and dryer do not have \\ninternet conductivity. Deceptive advertising indicating a cell phone and \\ntap here location however all this does is transfer information from the \\nappliance to the phone. The units themselves do not have any Wi-Fi \\nconnectivity. Another thing that I don\\'t like about this is you have to \\ngive it access to a lot of your personal information which is really \\ntotally unnecessary other than for their marketing purposes. Uninstalled. I \\ncertainly would be in on a class action suit for their false advertising..App say \"cannot run on rooted device\" then quits. My device is not rooted. \\nApp is broken.What a terrible app.  Social media authentication doesn\\'t even work properly.  Buggy and slow..The app would not let me log in. I used the same credentials that work on LG\\'s website, and it insists they\\'re wrong. The app is therefore completely unusable..Connected wifi extender. Followed instructions, machine never connected. \\nTotally useless..Why does this app needs to make calls ? This is absurd !   One of the reasons I bought a washing machine from LG, was because of the \"smart\" functions.   Now ... since smart is useless, I might go to LG\\'s local headquarters and ask for a discount or refund..Got the app because LG website said I could add my TV here to link it to \\nGoogle assistant. When I pressed + there was no option in the list to add a \\nTV. Only dryers, washers and other house hold appliances. Misleading and \\nwrong information is not ok..Why should we have to change apps LG? Smart laundary was working fine for \\nme. Also what\\'s with all the permissions required? I suppose you want my \\ndogs bank account information too I presume? Really LG, get a grip of your \\nsoftware department. Update: installed on my LG TV and won\\'t link accounts \\nwith Google. Signs in and asks to close browser and restart app. Then \\nnothing. Just constant loop.Wow, this is actually as bad as all the reviews say. The HomBot vacuum itself looks great and would probably do a great job but man, this app, that\\'s some shabby programming. Terrible loading indicators, no android native UI in some parts, strange background proceedings, app rights aren\\'t queried when needed but instead all at the beginning. Oh and yeah... Product registration fails every time or hangs at 40% until forever. Can\\'t get the bot to work. That\\'s 900¢æ I\\'m sending back just because of the app, as a programmer myself that hurts so much. LG I hope it hurts you as well. This app needs money and time, go help your programmers!.Not only won\\'t it work for me, at all, but 1). the previous version worked great on the 1of 2 ac units that successfully connected to Wi-Fi and 2). from what I\\'m reading here even when it does work the ac app has reduced functionality??  The guy in the shop when I purchased the ac units literraly said \"I\\'m not sure\" about the Wi-Fi app, but that the ac unit works well.  How right he was, I\\'m going to try emailing LG, good luck all.POS WHY THE F*** LG WON\\'T FIX THIS APP IS UNBELIEVABLY I HAD SAMSUNG S8 \\nPLUS WONT RUN ON ROOTED DEVICE I WOULD KNOW IF MY PHONE WAS ROOTED AND IT \\nIS NOT I NEED TO FIND A YELP PAGE IF NOT FIX I GOING BACK SAMSUNG AND \\nBELIEVE ME I KNOW LG DOESN\\'T CARE LG MUST BE GIVING THIS APP FOUR STARS NOT \\nONE ELSE WOULD.Found the app to be pretty useless. Washer and dryer both have the \"tag on\" icon, and phone has NFC enabled. Neither would connect at all. Just kept saying to hold the phone still until registration was completed, which after 5 minutes of waiting, never happened..App simply does not work well and it requires a ton of permissions. Why does this app need access to make phone calls and text?.Bought A LG smartThinQ TV, but can\\'t linked it to my Google Home or Amazon \\nAlexa. Everyone seem to have that problem too. I download this app to see \\nif I can fix the problem, but it request to access too much personal \\ninformation, and does not even link properly. Decided its not wise to have \\na foreign company asking all these private information. Returning the LG TV \\ntoday..Installed then immediately uninstalled. I was hoping I could turn off permissions afterwards but app won\\'t even open without turning them all on. I understand needing permissions for different aspects of the program, but it seems the failure of the design is that they should be on a \"as needed\" basis which would make more sense and should not scare off potential users like myself. I hope you rethink this I\\'ll check back because I would like to try using this feature of our not cheap  washer and dryer set..The app this replaced was great. This keeps showing product is registered but it never opens. Terrible!.This app tells me it won\\'t run on my rooted device, yet it has the gall to \\nwant to access damn near everything on my phone. Why would it need access \\nto my photos, camera, or microphone??.Does not work without unnecessary permissions! Very intrusive.Dryer has problem starting since purchased. Still waiting for repairs, parts on order. Old app would start Dryer from phone when downloaded, new app doesn\\'t. I now can\\'t dry clothes at all. LG will be getting a bill for drying clothing st laundromat or will be replacing unit as I have been waiting for parts & repair for a month now.....I just wanted to download a washer cycle for whites since the machine didn\\'t come with one.  None of the downloadable cycles were for whites.  The cycles offered didn\\'t have descriptions of what they do, other than vague titles.  And, why do they need all those permissions?  I\\'m uninstalling now..Absolutely no reason for this app to access sd card, location, or make phone cals and does not launch if denied.  Totally unsecire application will never be installed on any of my devices..It just fine. The usage information should be more complete. Average Including temperature rate, amount energy usage, and so on. So, user can behave accordingly..Downloaded the app from washer NFC, couldn\\'t find the washer once it \\ndownloaded. Forced it, the timer was off and it added more time itself. \\nStill don\\'t understand why they would need for my location to be on if this \\nwasher is at my home..I got the washer and i download this app and the water was so low and i hate that i keep trying water plus and it didn\\'t know what to do so i came to this app and i increase the water now its 85% love it.The app asks for too much personal information. All that I need is the app \\nto give me features to control my washer. Should I return the washer now \\nsince the sales guy promoted this app as if this is the future. I \\nabsolutely don\\'t see this as an IOT app. LG... build one that everyone \\nwould like to use..Force to update trend micro titanium prompted critical risk apps ask to uninstall.I didn\\'t think it was useful with my range. It\\'s faster to press the buttons then to load the app and hold it to the stove..There is no way I\\'m going to let LG have permissions that are needed to get \\nthe app to work. I\\'ll get up and press the start button on the washer thank \\nyou. If you value your privacy, DON\\'T USE THIS APP!.My front load washing machine shows smart diagnose app. And i dont have smart diagnosis app. If i download  lg smart thinq no option to connect it with machine.In Turkmenistan your local service personals are not qualified to fix \\ntroubleshooting. Cant believe such a big company cant deal with a service.why need my contact and photos info? It need photo switch on the washing machine? It will call me or call my friend when finish washing?  It such idiot apps. Stupid developer..I tried to run it, but get white screen which stuck forever after pushing of login button. I wasn\\'t able to go through it and removed it as absolutely useless application..App freezes, I was able to register only stove and it gets stuck and you have to close app. but when u open app.again is jamed where you left. Useless,very disappointed. Do they test these apps before they put it on market?.I love the refergerator but the app asking to make calls for me and access pice and media.  No can\\'t accept that.  How do I know what else is being done and or where it\\'s calling. The old app worked great.  But now it won\\'t let me use it.  Says must use this one.  Maybe return fridge..NFC doesn\\'t work with my washer and dryer, even though they have the symbol.  Reply: Yep, NFC is activated on my phone. I use it for Google pay and other apps..Great idea but terrible implementation. Very slow to load, clunky, takes an excessive amount of time to connect, and then a few weeks after I finally got it to work it somehow erased all the connections and says my lgusa account is not valid even though it works on the website..Since the last update it won\\'t even let me log in anymore. LG is awful and \\nI will never buy another appliance or for that matter anything from them \\nagain..I just bought a Lg washing machine, installed the SmartThinQ app as \\nindicated and when i open the app it says that it can\\'t be used in a rooted \\nphone, but my phone is not rooted!!!... and is new!. Big disappointment..Unnecessary permissions are a deal breaker. They should be optional at worst but you can\\'t even run the app without approving all of them. Why?.the most useless app I\\'ve ever used. I shouldn\\'t have to do detailed research to learn how to use an app..This piece of garbage does not let me pair my refrigerator. Waste of time \\nand false claims of features that just does not work..Registration fails every time yet I get notified when cycle is finished. \\nCannot make custom programs due to failed registration ??.Pathetic...doesnt pair to device... Would be perfect app for me if it asctually did what it said it did.After installing then registering then tried to pair my Lenova K6 \\nsmartphone tag on my new washing machine to be told my phone is not \\ncompatible, why?.This app is junk! My old app worked just fine. Do not download!.LG doesn\\'t let their app degrade without permissions. Why should I need \\nlocation, call permissions AND storage to send an NFC signal to my washer \\nfor my laundry settings?.The app sucks and pretty bad when there\\'s more negative ratings than \\npositive and nothing is done to fix it..This App doesn\\'t work at all. At start gives an error saying failed execution. Leave the old one..Says it does not run on a \"rooted device\" but my phone is NOT rooted and \\nwas never rooted. Besides that there is no reason that such an app does not \\nrun on a rooted device. I just payed $3600 for LG appliances and i payed \\nthat for having internet functionality..App wants far too much personal info. Pictures? Really? Also requires \\nmodifications of settings. I\\'m just. It \"going there.\" Deleted app..Heap of junk! Won\\'t connect to my LG washing machine with a smart diagnosis \\nlovo on the front - slow to respond, 100Mb install and wants access to \\neverything in your digital life. LG should be ashamed to have their name \\nassociated with this app..Spent 20 min trying to register washer and all I keep getting was an error saying to check my wifi settings. This was odd to me as the app changed my phone from my wifi to the wifi of the washer...Too bad wanted to get it to work..Absolute trash app.  You do not need to access my phone and contacts for your fridge app.  Dafuq, LG?.When I installed the app, it says your device is rooted and not working. Is \\nthere any solution? The app seems nice but unfortunately not working on \\nrooted device. Please help me!.Awful. Asks for to many permissions. Need an LG account. What about just let me connect to the freeze/fridge..I was forced to installed the new LG app and put my phone onto my neighbours mini. The mini lifted a foot off the floor, puff of smoke and now they have a Bentley Continental..Don\\'t tell me you are the technician and want my make and model !.I installed this app and uninstalled it immediately after being asked for \\npermission to access my photos and phone calls..Too many permissions with location service (not needed) plus you must log in.  I should not need to log on unless I\\'m using certain services.  If I\\'m checking on my laundry and stats, no need to log on..App just crashes on a Nexus smartphone with pure android. It couldn\\'t be worse..Incompatible with a Pixel 2 XL straight from Google... Good job testing \\nthis, LG.Menu fails to advance during product setup. Making the app useless and \\nuseable.Wants access to phone to make calls and access to my files do not get this read the permission before agreeing.Awful for my washing machine compared to the old one we need less tips and more features/stats not a stupid weather widget.Downloaded to use with my front loading washer. I spent a good 30 minutes with my phone, pressed against the tag on logo. I know my phone supports nfc, and that it works. Nothing happened. If I am going to pay extra money for a washer, all the features better work. Looks like I\\'m returning my washing machine..Like everyone else I just want to troubleshoot my damn washer. Why would the app need to control my phone or access my pictures?.horrible UI, not user friendly, difficult to connect to anything at all. And why would this app ever need access to my location and phone? it\\'s absolutely ridiculous, never using LG again.Dose nothing but download cycles. Mo explanation on how to use the cycle. App dose not allow for setting washing or how to use all the functions on machine. Expensive machine that is supported by nothing..Don\\'t want to give this app access to \"make and manage phone calls\" or my photos and media just so I can play around with the settings on my appliances.Why make an ap that tells you to install new ap when new ap then does not want to work with my product. I mean really it\\'s taking fuzzy logic to new levels..Crashes instantly after opening on Galaxy S7. Have tried uninstalling/reinstalling and rebooting device. Shame..This App worthy a 7 star not just a 5 So usefull and can use it so easly It fits with Tv. Fridge ,micro waves ,washing machine ,dryer ..... They have a plenty of programs that you never imagine that they are truly existing A large list of : lingerie, babys clothers ,suits ,steam program ,sport clothes , in washing machine You can use it as A remote Controle of your Tv yees i Confirm that Amazing LG soft a wooow App Thank you LG . THE LIFE IS REALLY SO GOOOOOD WITH YAAAAA.Tried installing and reinstalling twice. App can\\'t find my network, though everything else in the house finds it just fine. Waste of my time..I called lg customer service they told me to download lg smart laundry and it tells me it\\'s not for USA usage so I came to this app and I\\'ve uninstalled everything on my phone and it still tells me I don\\'t have enough storage wth really thinking about taking my washer and dryer back this is crazy.App won\\'t allow a rooted device to simply control my washer and dryer. \\nPathetic..I don\\'t want to register an account. I don\\'t want LG monitoring anything. \\nLet me use the app and monitor my appliances. Why won\\'t you just let that \\nbe? It worked on a previous version. Go back to that..App doesn\\'t work on my OP5. And yes, I\\'ve uninstalled and reinstalled it..Ok...just bought washer WT1501CW.  As a dumb IT guy, I follow the instructions and look for LG smart laundry & dw app which no longer exists---it\\'s called LG smart thinQ.  I think this is the right app.  I installed this monster sized app and it barely starts...and does ask for location permissions etc.  At this point I ask myself \"do I need o download more Wash cycles to the unit?\". I\\'ve sat down playing with this app and this review for more than an hour.  This is not SMART LG!!.This app wants to collect much more data then required, and who knows for what purpose it will be used, definitely not for my washmachine.This seems to be a force upgrade which I don\\'t want. My previous app seems to not work any more... perhaps they\\'ll remove and refund my appliance. Way to weird wasting people\\'s time written mod cons are supposed to save time.Completely useless, out of the four people in my house that tried to link or \\'register\\' with this app. Only one connection was made and that person laughed at the \\'features\\' and deleted it. Pointless..Can\\'t run it on a smartphone (the app doesn\\'t want to run because it\\'s \\nrooted). Can\\'t install on non-rooted tablet running Android 7.0 either - it \\nshows that device isn\\'t compatible..Terrible app.  You already bought the appliance, what do they care..Keeps saying won\\'t run on rooted device stock pixel 2 not rooted never \\nhave....It\\'s crap this is not as good as the last apps. And they were barely functional..Won\\'t let me register my appliances. Made me create a new account with lg, when I had one already. Rubbish!.Why you want so much access to my phone der lg. No no no ain\\'t gonna happen. Who you workin for huhnn.Trust me I have highend mobile but this app warking very slow  Plz don\\'t west data or time in this app.It is not good coz it takes many permissions that I don\\'t want.Latest app does not let me in why fix something that isnt broken.I don\\'t like the fact that it ask you for access to your content in the phone. that, if allowed, can delete and/or alter the SIM or anything within your device. also access to the mic, camera etc. of your device. if you deny it access it will not let you use the app..Doesn\\'t work. No sense buying an expensive fridge if this app doesnt work. Shameful on part of LG.the wifi feature aint working without the app.Unacceptable permissions.  This app wants my location, access to phone calls, and read/write access to all my files or it refuses to open.  Nope..The app should not need so many permissions just to work..Seriously, location? Okay.  Access pictures and make phone calls?  Nope, uninstalled.  Not giving away that kind of access to control an AC.It restarts every time you on it and often glitches, but usually works. Plus you can connect it to Google Assistant.Create an account to control devices, app is setup to farm purchased products customer details. In a world with identity theft why....App just crashes after update. It was a fantastic app and now it\\'s useless..Disappointed that the app doesn\\'t connect. Apparently a known issue. Can\\'t register and can\\'t take advantage of features I paid for..Didn\\'t work on my 3 year old LG Washer. Kept saying fails so I tried again and again..Doesn\\'t recognise my moto g5\\'s NFC function. will come back when there is an updated version.Stock answers and rationalizations aren\\'t making this app any better..In one word \"useless\" won\\'t even let me log in to my account so uninstall education it.Doesn\\'t work on Samsung Galaxy S8+  it used to work, but the newer version broke it.  Won\\'t open anymore..App keeps requiring me to agree to terms of use, then tells me I already have an account..Worthless app, and it requires too many permissions!.Too many permissions, simply don\\'t trust it so I\\'m uninstalling it. Love \\nthe LG wt7200 washing machine though..Doesn\\'t work and requires absurd permissions. Looks like LG is getting into the spyware business.If the app doesn\\'t open, than it shouldn\\'t even be advised with their products or on the app store. Lame!.Purchase a new washer and dryer and dryer is not working , keep getting an error and unable to download the app connected to my dryer.Washer does not connect. App is huge in size and is very slow..useless application tag on not working verified with samsung edge 7 , iphone 6 and lg  phone ...tag on was active with beam and p2p , taped phones on the right location but still not working...does it worth access to my folders calls and location  ? definitely not !!!.LG has dropped support for the TagOn tech they were selling just last year..Trys to connect to a smarthinq device but my dryer is older and has smart diagnosis instead. This is the app I was directed to d/l from their website. This doesn\\'t help me..Never got it to start. It crashed my phone every time..why does it need permissions for total phone control camera contacts media location contacts etc... get lost.Doesn\\'t work anymore.  Bring back the old app.  Can\\'t access device over cellular anymore.  Piece of junk.Invasive. Why do they need my birthdate and my phone logs? Don\\'t bother people..Doesn\\'t work just like every other LG app. You guys really suck..Takes forever to load the app. Please have the washer programs downloaded into mobile so that 10mins can be saved each wash..The app is not helpful. It wouldn\\'t recognize the tag on feature of my washer and dryer..Just a blank screen after loading the home screen..This app won\\'t make Wifi on LW8017ERSM (Air Conditioning) work.  Very disappointed!!!.I paid 3000$ worth of steam washer & dryer... And this is what i get? What a stupid.app . Useless..Locked up constantly too many permissions  requested.Why my lg microwave chef neo not connect with this app I\\'ll try so many time but uffff.Got new LG stove. Tried to use it getting error message. Not working. !!!!!.It won\\'t let me use the original...Makes me upgrade then tells me it\\'s not compatible!!!!!!  Now what.Doesn\\'t work unless you give it unnecessary permissions.It doesn\\'t work. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, that didn\\'t work. This app is literally useless..just updated the app and now it wont connect to my AC. this happens every time i update it!.Tried on 2 phones, product was never registered in the app. Very upset.Mandatory location permissions just to open the app, and then it forces you to make an account. For just looking up an error code that is needless..Jelek banget.. dipersulit... so so an pake banyak aturan.. pas dipake error ga niat.This app compromise securiry at so many levels. Not happening.Its a poorly designed app. LG need to improve it. Pick up your game LG..Anything  lower than a one star? Do not buy an oven expecting to operate it from your phone. App does not support iPhones and the app wants all kids of permissions to operate via Droid. Why does the oven app need to access my location, pictures, and contacts?.Deleting app. Has very unreasonable requests for permissions..Complete pain in the ass to use and have given up with it.It\\'s crashing as I try to open the app.  Waste of time and data..Huge breach of privacy just to download a wash cycle.Garbage. Why all tho permission. Deleted app.Does not work on rooted devices, why? It\\'s not a banking app..Why does this app need to control  my phone calls or access  files on the sd card. ????.Too many permissions.  Need to create account just to try it.  NFC feature could not find app..Trying to connect tag on machine to phone can be tricky. Overall a useful tool..What\\'s a point, it\\'s not working on my phone! Bad apps..Won\\'t fully install. Gets to 100% and sticks. This app stinks..Tells you to install another app and then error again.Does anyone beta test the app before they release to the general public? Fire the entire QA team....Application not executive.. Given error for lenovo zuk z1.The old app was perfect this new app don\\'t recognize my appliance.Can\\'t find the refrigerator. Have followed the instructions in the app, not \\nrocket science, but it refuse to connect to the refrigerator..App fail to start on my brand new phone..Why do you need unnecessary access and permission?.Won\\'t start without broad, unnecessary permissions..Hay LG Team Follow Samsung. There is no energy monitoring option on my Ari \\nCondition.Useless app. Can\\'t connect to my washing machine..It requires strange permissions! I just wanted to test the app before buying an LG product. Now I\\'m thinking about a different brand..IT WAS WORKING BEFORE YOUR UPDATE  NOW IT IS CRACHING ALL THE TIME . I REINSTALLING IT MORE THAN 3 TIME BUT NOTHING..Absolutely worthless, don\\'t waste your time it\\'s just a marketing gimmick.Does not work on rooted phones..Doesn\\'t even start, crashing everytime..Installed, it asked for permissions that the app had no right to without first explaining. And then my birthday .. why? Uninstalled.I can\\'t even get the app to launch to try and use it..it\\'s quite ridiculous.Doesn\\'t work unless I grant access to permissions for features that I don\\'t need. Poor app design..Doesnt work with my washer and dryer.App does not work after update.Interface is great. Love the simplicity of the app. One question, can this work on LG Hom-bot square (3.0)?.The app always stucks on my galaxy and cant connect to the cleaner! I have installed this app to my wifes LG4 and it work perfectly!.Useless at all with WM3488HW all in one washing machine.Incompatibilidad total con Alexa. No detecta TV. Podr?an actualizar la Skill para que conecte, como en USA.Doesn\\'t work, doesn\\'t connect to device..Worked fine then after a week it said it wasn\\'t connected and three days of messing with it and still nothing..They shutdown normal apps for the appliances then the new app doesn\\'t allow rooted phones... Why block rooted phone?.Resource hog, freezes phone.Does not connect my new a/c to phone. Is this going to get fixed? Can we have a date..Wouldn\\'t give me the login page.It doesn\\'t work in Android 6.I downloaded one app from google play then it asked to upgrade... but it does not downloading the new update.Why does the Smart Laundry app force you to use the Smart ThinQ app? Smart Laundry had several downloadable cycles. Smart ThinQ only has 1 downloadable cycle..Doesn\\'t even open. Crashes on startup..Never could get my washer to connect with the app..tried for 2 days!.Not worth it. Would like it if it works locally..Not connected with Google home mini.Does not work with Tag On.Won\\'t run. error code -1000 every time I try to start the app on an LG Nexus 5 with Nougat..Will not connect to new Wi-Fi washer washer has no NFC but app tries to \\nconnect to NFC.Permissions required for start are unacceptable..No way to work bad bad app.I don\\'t know why this app need to access my position and manage calls to be able to manage a washer machine!!!!.Why does LG need access to my photos? Just wanna do some laundry..I install it but it won\\'t open. Why? Hey LG, fix it..Useless , shameful for LG brand.Crashed upon first  run..Nuf said.App is asking for lots of permissions considering I need it only to deal with washing machine..Was able to download a cycle only once. Never worked again. Can\\'t pair it with my washer/dryer..Wants login to Samsung. Too many permissions needed..Could not even get the stupid app to launch on my LG smart phone, the old app was much better.It does not work..Cannot run on my Samsung phone or my Lenovo tablet!.LG response to my initial review is extremely unhelpful.Machine was connected for 1st week and part of 2nd The router is < 30 ft away & signal is strong.Dryer has had stable connection entire time.This is beyond a basic suggestion or even higher level troubleshooting that I have done w/customer service.Other than a possible glitch w/my version of the android operating system, this has to be a problem w/the machine. Customer service has not gotten back to me as promised on latest call..I know understand why all the 1 star ratings..Reduce permissions. They are ridiculous..Seriously ill advised move to disable a fully functional app with this white elephant...Not working. Can\\'t be open. Force close. Apps sucks. Support sucks. Still waiting for their promises for my bonus..Doesn\\'t even work for me....Wanted unneeded permissions..Point less app. Can\\'t even define custom cycles..Very much bad credit.Slow invasive l uninstalled it.Requires so much personal details for no reason.I will not make an account for my washing machine.
